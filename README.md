| `npm run metadata:extract "url"`                                      | Extract metadata for specific URL                 |

## Link Metadata Caching

The site uses a caching system for link metadata to handle sites that block requests during build time (like YouTube). Here's the workflow:

### 1. Development Mode
Run `npm run dev` and visit pages with `LinkPreview` components. This populates the cache with metadata.

### 2. Extract Metadata
Run `npm run metadata:extract` to see all cached metadata formatted as ready-to-copy Astro components:

```bash
# View all cached metadata
npm run metadata:extract

# Search for specific URL
npm run metadata:extract "youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123"
```

### 3. Update MDX Files
Copy the formatted components and paste them into your MDX files with manual overrides:

```astro
<!-- Before -->
<LinkPreview url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123" />

<!-- After -->
<LinkPreview 
  url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123"
  title="Video Title"
  image="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ABC123/maxresdefault.jpg"
  description="Video description"
/>
```

### 4. Commit and Deploy
Commit your updated MDX files (not the cache). GitHub Actions builds will use the manual overrides for reliable builds.

## Deployment

If you have the netlify CLI installed, you can run the following command to deploy the site:

```sh
netlify deploy --build --prod
```
