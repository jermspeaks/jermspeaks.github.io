## Review

> I wrote this short review for the first episode. All of them are good, especially the fifth one, later made into a theatrical movie called "A Short Film About Killing".

This was made for television? Damn, who knew the Polish had such great TV to watch. That aside, what a beginning. And what I mean is, what a deep and emotional journey this was. I had watched "The Double Life of Veronique" and the Colors trilogy last year, and knew I was in for a treat. And a box of tissues.

The score: Just like his later films, the score is minimalistic. That flute-pitched tone is memorable. It plays a large part of the emotion just as the actors. This is no exception.
