When Fury Road came out, my co-worker gave me nothing but strong accolades in recommending this film. She told me two executives from the studio were sent to check on why George Miller's film was going over-budget. After watching the spectacular feat that was the behind the scenes in filming that movie, the executives came back to tell the studio to give Miller more money.

And it showed. Fury Road was the unexpected hit from the director of "Babe: Pig in the City" and "Happy Feet Two". That is to say, no one was expecting another high-octane fueled hit from the director at this point in his career.

I say all of this as reflecting on it now, I didn't want to disappoint myself going into this movie 9 years after the Fury Road experience and come in with high expectations. And gosh darnit, the film didn't disappoint. This prequel built on top of the previous film and gave the wasteland a much richer experience than what I was expecting. A society built off the limited supply of water fueled by gas and guns. Factions of gangs embracing the weird and violent. And Furiosa's backstory felt more of a character study mixed with high tension action scenes. It's what I want from cinema. Something slightly silly, but also a lot of stakes at hand.

One unexpected thing I loved about the movie was Chris Hemsworth's performance. Besides his nose prosthetic, he really got into the role and didn't play the god-like character he's known for, but a schlub that builds his power only to squander it as an incompetent ruler. I think what makes these movies great is how you know every character is flawed and how everything will play out.

It goes without saying I'm going to return to this movie and see all of the things I missed. Please go watch it. I was surprised how much my wife also enjoyed this movie as this isn't her usual forte.
