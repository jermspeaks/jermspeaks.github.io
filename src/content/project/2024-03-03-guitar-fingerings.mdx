{/* ## What is a UUID?

A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number used to identify
information in computer systems. The term globally unique identifier (GUID)
is also used, typically in software created by Microsoft.

When generated according to the standard methods, UUIDs are for practical
purposes unique, without depending for their uniqueness on a central
registration authority or coordination between the parties generating them,
unlike most other numbering schemes.

While the probability that a UUID will be duplicated is not zero, it is close
enough to zero to be negligible. */}
