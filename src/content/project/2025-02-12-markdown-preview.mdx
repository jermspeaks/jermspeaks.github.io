The Markdown Preview Viewer includes the following features:

1. **Live Preview**: As you type markdown in the left panel, the output is rendered in real-time on the right panel, providing immediate feedback on your formatting.

2. **Syntax Highlighting**: The viewer supports syntax highlighting for code blocks using highlight.js, making your code snippets more readable with proper language-specific coloring.

3. **Rich Text Copying**: The "Copy to Clipboard" button preserves formatting when pasting into applications like Google Slides or other rich text editors. If HTML copying isn't supported, it falls back to plain text.

4. **Download as Markdown**: You can download your markdown content as a `.md` file for later use or sharing.

5. **Responsive Layout**: The viewer uses a two-column layout that works well on larger screens, with a clean and simple interface.

6. **Error Handling**: If there are any issues with parsing the markdown, clear error messages are displayed to help you identify and fix the problem.

7. **Markdown Element Support**: The preview supports all common markdown elements including:
   - Headers (H1, H2, H3)
   - Lists (ordered and unordered)
   - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
   - Inline code
   - Links with hover effects
   - Images with responsive sizing
   - Blockquotes
   - Tables with proper formatting

8. **Custom Styling**: Each markdown element is styled with careful attention to typography, spacing, and readability, ensuring your content looks polished and professional.
