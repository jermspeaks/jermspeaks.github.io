## Features

Users can create an account or log-in to do the following:

- update their posts with text or pictures.
- comment on anyone's status
- create statuses (that no one else needs to comment on!)
- be a friend to someone else, no limits!

## Website

[Flitr](https://flitr.herokuapp.com/) (sounds like 'Flirt') is hosted by Heroku and uses Amazon S3.
