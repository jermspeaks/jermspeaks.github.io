import JSONEditor from "../../components/JSONEditor.svelte";

I often need to beautify JSON, so I created this tool to help me do it quickly.

## JSON Editor

<JSONEditor client:load />

Mostly this is a beautifying JSON tool.

Extra features:

- If it sees there is a `query` property in the JSON, it will assume it is a GraphQL query or mutation and you can ask it to extract the query to read the string without all of the newlines.
