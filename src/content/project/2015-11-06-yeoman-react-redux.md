Yeoman is a code generator in Javascript. This open-source library is for generating React Components, Redux actions and reducers.

## Project Description

A Yeoman generator for React & Redux for projects vertically integrated.

Of those out there, the React and Redux templates have a horizontal structure for their projects.
This means all of your elements belong in the same folder, i.e. your components
go in a `components` folder.

This generator works for vertically integrated React and Redux projects. The
sub-generator will create modules for you with a smaller version of the
horizontal structure. Each module is self-contained, although there may be a
base that is `common` to everything else.

This repo is copied from [React/Flux Vertical generator](https://github.com/jermspeaks/generator-react-vertical), which I'm de-comissioning in favor of this one.
