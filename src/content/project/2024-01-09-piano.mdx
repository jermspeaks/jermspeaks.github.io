import Piano from "../../components/Piano.svelte";

This is a little play piano I made as part of exploring with [Make Real](/blog/2024-01-08-make-real/).
It's been fun to see the limitations of what the tool can do, as well as understand
what Web Audio can do.

Of course, this comes after some coding clean-up and getting the audio context working.
There's a lot of bugs and corner cases to handle, so I'll leave this here as is 
and maybe place the code in an open source repo at some point.
