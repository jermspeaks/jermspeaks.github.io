I like to share. Maybe I'm too much of an over-sharer. Especially things I'm learning, new insights I've gained, experiences that have shaped me. But when it comes to the space of an about page, my mind draws a blank. Initially, this was a short blurb that I'd copy and paste to LinkedIn, but then it sounded too much like a bio you find on the sleeve cover of a hardcover book.

Instead, I've left this area for writing about myself in one, long page. Feel free to stay, or not. I have plenty of sufficient writing that I think is useful for most people. If you do decide to stay, brew some tea or coffee, make yourself at home, and enjoy this mini autobiography.
