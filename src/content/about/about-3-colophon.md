In printmaking, this is a brief statement at the end of a book or manuscript, typically used to describe the details of its production. For this website, it is how the site is made.

### Tech Stack

This website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The previous site was built using Jekyll, Sass, Bourbon, Neat, and Netlify. I wrote a short blog post about this [here](/blog/2023-05-02-website-rewrite/).

The [newsletter](/curation/newsletter) is powered by [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/).

The domain is registered with [Hover](https://www.hover.com/).

### Typography

This website uses ‚ÄúBrother 1816‚Äù, a font by Ignacio Corbo and Fernando D√≠az of [TipoType](https://tipotype.com/). The previous font we used for decorating the newsletter was Festivo LC Basic Dots by [Ahmet Altun](https://www.fontspring.com/foundry/ahmet-altun).

I love using Futura when I have time to go to the letterpress shop at [San Francisco Centter for the Book](https://sfcb.org/).

### Components

I use a number of components in Astro for reusability.
