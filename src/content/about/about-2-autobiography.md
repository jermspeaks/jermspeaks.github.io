### At the heart of it, I'm making things

When someone tells me they're doing something for their resume, I cringe. I'm not here for a participation badge, I'm here to make things. And sometimes, those things are useful.

I find that I enjoy learning. There's ups and downs, especially when I'm out of my comfort zone. There might be times where I feel like giving up, because something is too difficult. I'm reminded to keep a [growth mindset](/curation/books/2015-02-09-mindset) and allow myself to be malleable and flexible rather than rigid and set in my ways. Of course, it's a spectrum and you can't qualify that for everything, so pick and choose.

I went to school for making physical things, but I fell in love with making digital things more. I still love the craft of metalworking and woodworking, but I certainly craft more code nowadays. Sometimes for the benefit of code itself, but more likely for the benefit of the people who use it. I especially enjoy making things in collaboration because knowledge sharing is a powerful tool. Some of the software projects span across different domains, from my day job doing BioTech, [neurogaming](/project/2015-05-02-pac-man/), [data visualization](/project/2017-10-15-garbage-in-garbage-out/), and [mixed reality apps](/project/2016-06-04-zika-vr/).

### My personal pursuit of creativity

I feel most alive when I'm chasing my creative spark. From making [holiday cards](/project/2019-12-05-holiday-charity/) for a group of strong and weak ties, writing content, practicing music, baking something sweet enough, to cooking something gourmet. I used to think I was a jack of all trades, master of none. But I've stopped that line of thinking, and have changed my tune to being multi-faceted. Many times, we get stuck in one identity, like "I'm an engineer", and that's how you see your life. The people who inspire me have diversifying roles, like an engineering manager and pilot, a supply chain manager and a musician, a tech writer and a chef.

Sometimes I'm afraid to start. That's when I return to "[An Invocation for Beginnings](/blog/2015-03-23-on-an-open-dialogue/)", where the first step is to start small, keep it routine, and do 1% more the next day. And the best time to start is when you ask yourself with a "should" question. "Should I start working out?" "Should I start writing this idea I started in the shower?" And when I use the word "but", it's usually a personal excuse that is irrational, like 99% of the time. "I'd love to start baking, but I need the kitchen to be speckless first".

### Life's Maxims

<!-- > The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.
> ‚Äî Alan Watts -->

- Return to a [Beginner's Mind](https://zenhabits.net/beginner/). Starting from a beginner's mind opens yourself to new and radical ideas. Having an expert's mind rejects new ideas and sticks to what they know.
- Feedback should be actionable, specific, kind (and consensual)
- Professionally be a problem solver. Personally, use the "[Helped, Heard, or Hugged](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/well/emotions-support-relationships.html)" Framework
- Be comfortable being uncomfortable
- Consistent exercise is better than no exercise
