I've worked with Brian for the past 2.5 years, and he's super technical. Here's looking for new opportunities! He's looking to pivot to the gaming industry, so if you or anyone you know has any opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out!

And here's my tagline for Brian: IT expert, Game Dev enthusiast, and Black Rock Rangers volunteer.
