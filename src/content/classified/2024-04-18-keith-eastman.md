> Paths are made by walking

I've worked with Keith for the past 3 years, and he's as sharp as they get. I'll leave a blurb he wrote for looking for new opportunities below.

> Hey everyone, I am an accomplished Scrum Master and Project Manager looking for a management role. In the three years at Clear Labs, I have specialized in triage and security with a background in leading process development efforts and tooling integrations for cross-functional teams in delivering integrated, automated next generation sequencing solutions.
> Grateful for any assistance and advice you might provide.

And here's my tagline for Keith: Project Manager expert and scrum master with a background in tech.
