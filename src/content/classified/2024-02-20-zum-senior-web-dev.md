title: Zum - Senior Web Engineer
---

My former collegue's company, Zum, is looking for a Senior Backend Engineer.
If you're interested, reach out to me and I can refer you to the position.

More highlights beyond the JD. The codebase is in Angular and you'll be the first
on-site hire for the team who is primarily based in Eastern Europe.

They recently went Series E, and if you want a good opportunity plus a possibility
of a potential IPO soon, this is a good company to work for.
