I've worked with Marlone for the past 5 years, and he's a fantastic developer. Here's his blurb.

> I am a skilled software engineer with 7+ years of professional experience. I excel in building user-friendly and intuitive designs, implementing functional web applications, and improving customer conversion rates. My expertise lies in JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and responsive web design, along with skills in TypeScript, CSS, UI design, and UI patterns. 
>
> My most notable career achievement has been building the Clear Labs PCR culturing and antigen-based tests platform.
> 
> The project gained Clear Labs 15 additional customers within the first 3months of release and was able to secure the company a series C funding of $60milliion in an oversubscribed funding round due to the level of interest it generated. The funding was able to be used to help increase the availability of the company's solutions to help labs and clinicians more easily identify and trace all strains of pathogens, like SARS-CoV-2, Salmonella and Listeria.
