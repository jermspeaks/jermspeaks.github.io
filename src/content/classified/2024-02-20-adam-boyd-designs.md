title: Adam Boyd Designs - Handcrafted Sterling Silver and Copper Jewelry
---

Adam Boyd was our former intern at Clear Labs. He also hand crafts his own jewelry.


> Each piece of jewelry in this shop is designed and hand crafted using 100% solid silver, copper and brass. The silver that I use is of extremely high quality, composed of 92.5% Silver (or more) and copper. I buy from trusted suppliers and do not use silver that contains nickel. This means that the the jewelry found here will not cause irritation to sensitive skin. If you are allergic to copper, my jewelry can be made from 99.9% pure silver instead (Contact Me). No plated components are used unless specified in the description.
> 
> I often use a variety of precious and semi-precious stones in my designs, each hand selected by myself. I strive to find gemstones with unique and beautiful qualities that will stand out in the jewelry designs and that will create one of a kind pieces that will become favorites in your jewelry box.
> 
> I am happy to accommodate one off and custom designs. If you have a jewelry design in mind that you would like realized, please don't hesitate to ask. I am happy to work with you to bring you ideas to life.

I highly recommend his items.
