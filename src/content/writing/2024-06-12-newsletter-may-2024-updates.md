This month's newsletter is purposefully shorter because I got married this month! I decided to take off time from work and other obligations to embrace the moment. There's times in our lives we want to cherish the experience over spending time lost in our devices, so I dedicated two weeks to wedding preparation, having the wedding, and enjoying a much needed break on our honeymoon.

I hope you all are doing wonderful and looking forward to starting something fresh in June!
