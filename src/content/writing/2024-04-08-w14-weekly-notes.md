Last week, I launched the [Stream](https://craftbyzen.com/curation/stream/) which I'm proud of. I finally have a short space to write things down quickly and post to the website, rather than the longer posts for my essays. It all blurs together as I work on different output types. At some point, I want a more robust content funnel for writing. Or somewhere I can see the progress of different writing pieces visible on one dashboard.

- Last week was April Fools. For the roundup, we have AdWeek's [Stunts, Pranks and Fools](https://www.adweek.com/agencyspy/stunts-pranks-and-fools-for-april-fools-day/), [big brands trying to give us a laugh](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/04/01/april-fools-day-2024-brands-companies-pranks-jokes/73138684007/), and [more pranks](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/april-fools-day-2024-best-pranks-b2521561.html).

- A summary of [Dan Murray-Serter on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/danmurrayserter/status/1748722134187151511)
  1. Do a brain dump
  2. Separate Tasks. Like an Eisenhower Matrix
  3. Create a Morning Routine list (I've got mine under the start-up tasks)
  4. Time Block
  5. Connect Tasks to Goals
  6. Stop Overloading your list
     - 3-5 major tasks and 1-2 minor tasks are enough.
  7. Review your list at the end of the day
     - Celebrate the wins
     - Analyze what's missed (which helps tomorrow's list)
