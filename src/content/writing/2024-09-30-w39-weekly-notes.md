Last week, I deployed a website called [Make 50 Things](https://50things-nine.vercel.app/). I'm proud of taking the first step, but there's so much more to do on this website, including adding webmentions, adding my own 50 projects, making it open for others to add their own 50 things, and to make a linkroll of all of the 50 projects other people have created.

Also, I started [100 Days of Note-Taking from Bianca Pereira](https://biancapereira.gumroad.com/l/100-days-of-note-taking?sh_kit=5c7fe32bb8e2ee6c4a1e2d851eedb0864538daec53fcf4f4c87e734908375dcb). I'm loving it so far!

### Around the technosphere

- BBC - [The Bitcoin bros who want to crowdfund a new country](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyl171lyewo) - Ugh
- WordPress News - [WP Engine is not WordPress](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/)
  - The story has progressed further, where WP Engine is suing for defamation and Auttomatic is counter-suing.
- Yahoo Finance - [Zoom to Cut Back on Stock-Based Compensation, Joining Salesforce, Workday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoom-cut-back-stock-based-200956939.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter&guccounter=2) - Power to the higher-ups, and not to the people?
- Steve Newman - [The Problems That Google Docs Never Solved](https://amistrongeryet.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-google-docs)
- [Duocon](https://duocon.duolingo.com/) was last week (Duolingo Conference)
- I took the HTML 2024 survey and learned a bunch of things, like the File System Access API and forms within dialogs
- I finally setup [Hyperkey](https://hyperkey.app/). I didn't realize they had a setting called "quick tap" option that re-maps it to escape. Finally can open up opportunities in keyboard shortcuts!
- Meta Quest Blog - [Orion: True AR Glasses Have Arrived](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/orion-ar-glasses-augmented-reality/)
- Eleanor Konik - [ðŸŒ² On finding relevant notes when you need them](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/p/on-finding-relevant-notes-when-you)
  - It sounds like I should use AI with my obsidian vault. Or the very least with a notion so that I can find things that I couldn't find years ago. Samantha search versus AI search seems to be the differentiator.
