### Guides

Dealing with passive aggressive attacks

1. **Reformulation**: Reformulate their remarks to expose their "real" meaning.
2. **Ask Questions**: Ask questions to force them to express themselves openly.
3. **Sarcasm**: Use sarcasm to turn the blame back on them.
4. **Accountability**: Hold them accountable for their behavior.
5. **Focus on the Attack**: Focus on the attack, not the person.
