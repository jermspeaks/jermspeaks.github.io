### Summary

The second week into the second trump presidency, and it's been miserable. There's endless news on that. At home, we are starting to make sure we are prepared for the worst. The tariffs are around the corner, and there's not much we can do about it.

### Notes

The billionaires are pathetic. So are the men's rights activists

Notes on the podcast, [Coding Agents Cursor + Windsurf Tips - Syntax #871](https://syntax.fm/show/871/coding-agents-cursor-windsurf-tips)

- Different modes: Chat, Composer, Agent, Inline chat
  - Chat might be going away.
  - I've been using chat for creating outlines for presentations and create readmes
  - Composer will create files for you, but you have to use a diff tool first to figure out if you actual want it or not
  - Agent will run tools, run terminal commands, and go through your codebase. I haven't tried this one yet
- Cursor rules
  - [Learn Cursor](https://cursor.directory/learn) - Cursor directory for cursor rules
  - Default ways, like libraries to use, which version of libraries
    - E.g. use esm, use typescript, stick to camelcase, use Svelte 5
- Screenshots - you can pass along screenshots to help you, whether that's the app or an image of a PDF, like tables. You can technically add PDFs as well
- You can give it links to documentation, but this can be hit or miss
- Refactor to separate files rather than refactoring existing files. This might be **extremely** useful for a large migration.
  - Good for React components to a different one, then maybe refactor the existing file to relabel as deprecated and use a deprecated flag
- Use them to build quick projects. Doesn't have to be big and fancy. Even a page to help you visualize the new Set rules
  - Which is great to segway to have them help visualize
- Use it to experiment
  - Use it to branch out (git) and try different animations
  - Example: Wes created a fire dispatch tool to send out tweets or alerts when there are paramedics around and having it parse out that information to a stream people can easily consume

[How to improve your WFH lighting to reduce eye strain • Russell Baylis - Designer](https://rustle.ca/posts/articles/work-from-home-lighting)

1. An even, diffused lighting environment is best for the eyes
2. When it comes to light brightness, too much is just as problematic as too little
3. Use natural light wherever possible
4. Quality of artificial light matters
5. The best lighting for camera, is not necessarily the best lighting for ergonomics
6. Even the perfect lighting environment will fatigue you — take breaks, and take care of yourself
