As part of the [curations](/curation), I have added an
[inspirations](/curation/inspiration) section.

For the past few years, I‚Äôve kept a note of inspirational websites. These websites include blogs that I continue to follow, creatives showing their talents, and web design that makes me wonder. I remember years ago, Ayush and I would break down websites that made us go, ‚ÄúHow did they do that?‚Äù and reverse engineer them. It was interesting going into the source code, trying to solve how someone managed to wrangle with CSS to create a pretty infinite scrolling experience.

I wanted to share some of those websites with you. In the inspirations section, I break down which websites I‚Äôve found and share them with you. I am starting with people whose work I admire and ideas within it that I want to remix back to this website.

Sometimes these websites are minimal, and there‚Äôs elegance to it. Sometimes, there‚Äôs a lot of interactivity and media, and it‚Äôs not overwhelming. When I think back to this website, I‚Äôm constantly wondering what I could add, and more importantly, remove. It‚Äôs a constant battle to strike the right balance in design.

Watch out for more updates to inspirations, including written work, YouTubers, and so much more. There‚Äôs overlap with [creators](/curation/creators), but that‚Äôs a deeper dive into an artist‚Äôs work. I‚Äôm looking forward to updating these inspirations from time to time.
