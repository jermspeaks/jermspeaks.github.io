I needed a regular expression for checking if a number has 1 decimal point.
Here's the regular expression ChatGPT came up with: `/^\d+(\.\d{1})?$/`

Of course, it wasn't actually the correct requirement. 
It needed to check if it's an integer (no decimal points). 
And if it is a decimal point, it can be at most one. 

I screwed up and tried to pair two quantifiers together.
So if you have `?` and you want to use `{0,1}`, you can't do `{0.1}?`.

And I didn' need the group, although in retrospect, using the quantifier on the 
group works, but removing the group makes the `?` obsolete.

Here's what I ultimately came up with.

```js
function validateToOneOrNoDecimalPoint(number) {
    // Regular expression to match numbers with either 0 or 1 decimal point (optional)
    const regex = /^\d+\.?\d{0,1}$/;
    return regex.test(number);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(validateToOneOrNoDecimalPoint(3.5));   // true
console.log(validateToOneOrNoDecimalPoint(10));    // true
console.log(validateToOneOrNoDecimalPoint(2.34));  // false (more than one decimal point)
console.log(validateToOneOrNoDecimalPoint(5.));    // true (no decimal point)
console.log(validateToOneOrNoDecimalPoint(5));     // true (no decimal point)
```

And I added even more test cases, and used `regex.match` over `regex.test`.
Subtle difference.
