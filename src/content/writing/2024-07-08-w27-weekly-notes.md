Morgan and I are doing Camp NaNoWriMo this month and we were reviewing strange Sci-Fi concepts. This one in particular peaked her interest.

- [New prison concept could see inmates serve sentences in minutes](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/new-prison-concept-could-see-inmates-serve-sentences-in-minutes/ar-BB1oSB5A)

My own interests this time around is to write a story I know a ton about - film history and preservation.

To add to my watchlist is "The Beast". I love the Sci-Fi concept of living past lives, and this sounds right up my alley. I think I really want to write a Sci-Fi thriller that goes through past lives. I know there have been similar veins in "Everything, Everywhere All At Once" and Matt Haig's "The Midnight Library". If you love these kinds of movies and books about alternate realities, let me know. This may be the premise of another short story I would love to write.

### Around the blog

I've made some updates this week in terms of content and quality of life. This includes [all curation posts in one page](/curation/all). Adding the full timestamp on the bottom. Adding the author to all blog posts. And fixed some cover images on some book posts.

### Everyone's favorite topic: AI

- The New York Times - [Consulting Firms Are the Early Winners of the AI Boom](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/technology/ai-consultants.html?unlocked_article_code=1.200._ADp.ZR_fZkNud6nj&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)
  - I read somewhere comparing AI to the Internet boom from the 90's. Except there's a major difference: Cost. To train AI models and the cost to compute takes a lot of GPUs, of which it's hard to innovate. These consulting firms feel like they are selling slightly better workflows but certainly not 10x the output.
- Also a calling for a more human web - [Manifesto for a Humane Web](https://humanewebmanifesto.com/)

Answer: high tech means high maintenance costs. Think hard about its LTS if we're talking about companies who have to release one or more products a year.

Although the birthdate is quite contentious as the creator might have been traveling around this time. It didn't debut officially in the restaurant's menu until 1926. The location where it was originally served claims to serve the recipe, although modified to include anchovies. Certainly I'll travel to Tijuana and try it out.
