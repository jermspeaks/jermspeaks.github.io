Sometimes, I feel like the news is ramping up the demise meter by forcing down our media consumption one terrible news cycle after another. What started with an [deluge](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/02/biden-replacement-00166318) of [pieces](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/joe-biden-democratic-nominee.html?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20240711&instance_id=128464&nl=the-morning&regi_id=197092347&segment_id=171842&te=1&user_id=53888c42b17ce2b613ad43a8e73d64ef) to [replace](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/11/us/politics/2024-election-biden-democratic-nominee.html?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20240711&instance_id=128464&nl=the-morning&regi_id=197092347&segment_id=171842&te=1&user_id=53888c42b17ce2b613ad43a8e73d64ef) President Biden from the race and ending with an [assassination](https://www.npr.org/sections/the-picture-show/2024/07/14/g-s1-10096/photos-see-how-trump-rally-shooting-unfolded) [attempt](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/13/us/biden-trump-election?campaign_id=190&emc=edit_ufn_20240713&instance_id=128734&nl=from-the-times&regi_id=197092347&segment_id=172115&te=1&user_id=53888c42b17ce2b613ad43a8e73d64ef) of [Former](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/11/opinion/editorials/donald-trump-2024-unfit.html?unlocked_article_code=1.6U0.8c4B.AsIfR0wtqUTz) [President Trump](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/opinion/the-trump-shooting-conspiracies-outpaced-reality/ar-BB1pYv8R). In the chaotic nature of news makes me feel nervous, like there is no stability in our world. Entropy wins, and we can't expect more than chaos. But there's optimism inside of me, knowing there is a better future, which we have to make changes in the present for them to be realized. Dare I say, manifest.

That said, maybe it's the heat that's getting to us. - [Death Valley reached 129 Degrees](https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/i-went-to-death-valley-to-experience-129-degrees/ar-BB1pNJZ5?ocid=spartandhp&cvid=1b9b97f92bde4a59827e436af09bd407&ei=18). This heat dome was enough for me to stay inside or to go to the pool. Stay cool out there!

### Tools for Thought

- [Writer - The full-stack generative AI platform](https://writer.com/) - I've been thinking of what AI tools could look like, and this one I think was really thought out well.

### AI

- [LLM101n: Let's build a Storyteller](https://github.com/karpathy/LLM101n) by Andrej Karpathy. The course isn't started yet, but the syllabus looks promising
- Ethan Mollick on his newsletter One Useful Thing - [Gradually, then Suddenly: Upon the Threshold](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/gradually-then-suddenly-upon-the?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)
  - Technological change often happens gradually, then suddenly as key thresholds are crossed.
  - AI models are rapidly improving and crossing key capability thresholds, making them more useful tools.
  - Tracking AI's evolving capabilities through an "impossibility list" can help understand its rapid progress.
  - Also, if you haven't used Claude's artifacts, it's helped me quite a bit with generating diagrams (mostly in mermaid since it's compatible with Obsidian's markdown flavor)
- Conrad Gray reviews [Superintelligenceâ€”10 years later](https://www.humanityredefined.com/p/superintelligence10-years-later?utm_source=tldrai)
- Lilian Weng - [Extrinsic Hallucinations in LLMs](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ainews-to-be-named-3686)

- [GitHub Copilot Extensions are all you need](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2024/06/24/extensions-are-all-you-need)

### Web Dev and Tangents

- A great write-up about [Enhancing The New York Times Web Performance with React 18](https://open.nytimes.com/enhancing-the-new-york-times-web-performance-with-react-18-d6f91a7c5af8) by Ilya Gurevich from the New York Times about using the new APIs from React 18 and how that migration went. As I've worked in this before, it was interesting how existing interactive elements had to be re-worked with a different script. It's fascinating what the Times does to keep up to date with these frameworks.
  - When I talked to the Cooking team about how they keep recipes, it's apparent to me how much Engineering effort they take to make sure it's all running smoothly.
  - The results show for themselves

- [James M. Inhofe, Senator Who Denied Climate Change, Dies at 89 - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/us/politics/james-inhofe-dead.html) - holy hell, this is a brutal, scathing obituary I've ever read. Makes sense for this man. He had long covid, which related to the next item.
  > Mr. Inhofe opposed abortion, L.G.B.T.Q. rights, health care legislation and campaign-finance reforms while supporting the death penalty, gun rights, counterterrorism powers, offshore oil drilling and constitutional amendments to require balanced budgets and ban flag desecration
