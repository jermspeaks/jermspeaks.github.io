There isn't much to update. This has been a slower week for me.

I'm thinking more about making small spaces online, and I'm thinking more
holistically about what that philosophy means to me. As well as gathering examples.
If you run a small website, reach out to me about how you're treating your small
communities and how others can benefit.

Here's the article in question: [Where have all the websites gone?](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/). I love this idea of a linktree alternative.
