- sometimes what we as humans think is hard is not actual to robots. The inverse is similar

I've been messing around with Cursor AI a bit this week, thanks to some Egghead videos.

- [Search All of GitHub's Code and Pass the Results to AI Agents in Cursor | egghead.io](https://egghead.io/search-all-of-git-hubs-code-and-pass-the-results-to-ai-agents-in-cursor~moi1h)
- The composer tool is really powerful
- [Generate Custom .cursorrules for Your Project Based on Community Examples | egghead.io](https://egghead.io/generate-custom-cursorrules-for-your-project-based-on-community-examples~eimq2)

Browse for me. Can you export the playwright code after running so you can?

- [Agent Settings - Browser Use](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/agent-settings)
- [browser-use/browser-use: Make websites accessible for AI agents](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use)

What the author is noting is there are no climate refugees because we are all at some climate risk, which is made worse with climate change. He lived through the 1978 fires where his father would hose down the house in case the nearby fires spread. It’s also an ode to the Palisades. Also, there’s an action plan at the end on how to be more fire resistant.

- [47 Years Later, The Palisades Disappeared Overnight » Mike Industries](https://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2025/01/47-years-later-the-palisades-disappeared-overnight)

Two articles about living with chronic pain. I wanted to see what these five things are and how we can shift public attitudes

- [Chronic Pain: Five Things We Know About Causes, Treatments and Diagnoses - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/magazine/chronic-pain-what-we-know.html)
- [Chronic Pain Afflicts Billions of People. It’s Time for a Revolution. - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/magazine/chronic-pain.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ok4.XvGv.xtMuH9_DZJah&smid=url-share)

I read through this and am convinced Matt Mullenweg is on some trip no one else wants to be on. To rip apart the ideals of open source and make things more closed to the community tell me his own ideals have shifted.

I’m curious about this video. Novati no longer works at Meta. He is credited for the most number of commits, which should always be taken with a grain of salt. I’m sure they will talk about develop productivity.
