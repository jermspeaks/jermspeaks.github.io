Last week felt weird. Like a strange Halloween that was misplaced. I was heavily distracted by election news this week and have been putting off the previous week's notes.

BBC - [Dublin: Hundreds gather in streets for hoax Halloween parade](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr4y1j91x7o)

I'm continuing the week notes format like I did last week with topic-based notes. It seems to be helping me get acclimated to stop organizing everything.

Expect more election news next week as I get caught up.

### Process Studies Takeaways

Astral Codex Ten (Scott Alexander) - [Notes From The Progress Studies Conference](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/notes-from-the-progress-studies-conference?hide_intro_popup=true)

- Progress is good, but progress slowed around 1970. Nobody knows why, but theories include shifting social attitudes, over-regulation, or exhausting the potential in a few big inventions like electricity and mass production. This slowing was a great historical tragedy.

### Election Chaos

I'm writing this post-election, so some of this is kind of outdated now.

- [Did My Friends Vote](https://app.impactive.io/did_my_friend_vote) - the website is now down until counties finish counting. This was good to double check my voting record.
- [Hundreds of ballots possibly burned after Vancouver ballot box arson: FBI investigating](https://katu.com/news/local/vancouver-ballot-box-seen-smoking-same-morning-as-portland-ballot-box-arson) - No wonder the pre-election chaos was so noisy. This happened close to where some friends live
