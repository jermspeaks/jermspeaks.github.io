I'm back from the very last [Strangeloop](https://thestrangeloop.com) and from visiting my cousin for her baby shower in Las Vegas. I forgot how it feels to do non-stop traveling back-to-back. Reminds me of the time I traveled across the US, then hopped on a plane to South Korea.

I took this idea of "Weekly Notes" from [Jamie Tanna](https://www.jvt.me/) who I met at Strangeloop, and I thought this would be a wonderful recurring segment for the blog. Even if I have low readership, this is a nice capsule to look at for my monthly, quarterly, and annual reviews. üòÅ

- Derek Sivers updated his post on [Tech Independence](https://sive.rs/ti), where it's a single command now
- [DALL¬∑E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3) - [[OpenAI]] updated DALLE where prompt engineering is needed much less. Positioning is a lot better, with context
- There's a new map style on OpenStreetMap.org! The Tracestrack Topo map from [@tracestrack](https://en.osm.town/@tracestrack).
  - ![](https://cdn.masto.host/enosmtown/media_attachments/files/111/120/641/540/173/957/original/67e575312802ac02.jpg)
- I would love to train an AI to teach [dying languages](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000192416). It was inspiring to see OpenAI use GPT-4 to [help the Government of Iceland](https://openai.com/customer-stories/government-of-iceland) with this problem.
- Watched Martin Kleppmann's talk from Strangeloop: "New algorithms for collaborative text editing"
  - <iframe class="aspect-video w-full my-2" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mr0a5KyD6BU" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  - Absolutely fascinating how he breaks down the algorithms in [Automerge](https://automerge.org/).
  - I had no idea Martin (et al) came up with the idea of [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/)
  - For those who don't know, Martin wrote [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) , which is like the bible for distributed computing.
