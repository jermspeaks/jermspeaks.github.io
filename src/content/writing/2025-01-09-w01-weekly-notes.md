Its the end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025! I've changed up how I do daily notes, and in part this will change my weekly notes format. The unstructured version of daily notes means I should make it easier on myself to publish this.

David Cain experimented with the year of depth back in 2017. I want to read more about how this affected him. I’m going through one of these types of years to really slow down and understand things deeper, not as much as I can. I suffer too much of that and the [[2025 Year of Capacity]] is acknowledging I can’t do, read, consume everything

I read this blog post, and it irked me. I dug a little deeper, and making bold statements without understanding the repercussions make me resent I was reading this at all. Sure, there's "doing Elon's bidding" with the new DOGE, but it goes way deeper than that. The need to continue hustling (i.e. hustle mode) vs. taming the ego really showed here. This person was putting out their thoughts, so I understand this isn't supposed to be relatable. But their public persona is what really bothered me.
