Coming out of vacation is hard to transition back into the normal routine gears. As such, it's the end of the week and I haven't reviewed my notes from the previous week.

I lost my sense of smell, known as [parosmia?](https://www.webmd.com/brain/what-is-parosmia), and it completely threw me off guard. And by losing your sense, you notice the hidden ways you use your nose. Like detecting smoke, cooking, and tasting food. Or the smell of the outdoors like petrichor after it rains.

I'm trying something new with this week's format. It took far longer to create, so I think I might scale it back next week. Let me know if you like this better.

  > For those who are curious, my system is Inbox Ten. That means I aim to end every day with fewer than ten emails in my inbox. I also have fewer than ten open chat threads across all interfaces. I’ve also read all relevant notifications in internal tools, read all relevant posts in internal groups I care about, and started rough drafts of any relevant proactive communications I intend to produce.

> Amateurs, in contrast, are not certified as knowing. They may or may not know, and their “knowledge” may or may not be trustworthy, but they are always seeking. They are striving to know, in their own ways of knowing, ways that are meaningful to them but may or may not be meaningful to others. Amateurs are always learning, never at a steady state of knowing.
