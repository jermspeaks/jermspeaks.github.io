After a month long break, we're back! The reason for my absence is I got married! üíí

![At the altar](../../images/Married.jpeg)

It's been one crazy month. Everything leading up to the wedding was a whirlwind.
Everything after the wedding has been nice and calm. We spent our honeymoon in Maui, then all of last week after our return, we spent on the couch sick with COVID-19.

This week, we're back. I'm coming back at you all with some links that I found for the entire month. After this update, I'm going to overhaul a few things about the weekly notes.

  - I'm pretty mad about this article. What I'm taking away from it is the low level details don't matter for human comprehension. That's really not true. Many times, assumptions are made early on that take a codebase one way, then later on, the requirements change and logic needs to be adjusted.
  - I'm not sure this person has spent enough time with LLMs on how messy the code they write is. Like it's fairly unoptimized and feels extremely hacky. Yes, the code will be better in the future, but today's LLMs don't have this yet. And to expect a CEO to determine how this code is run is terrible because the nuances of what needs to be comprehended is not there.
  - Instead, the work of an engineer isn't to read prompting with the LLMs output is but to decide if the code is maintainable. The idea of configuration over convention increases cognitive exercise, not decreases it. The article assumes the LLM output can read and write through the code and the engineer is lazy and doesn't want to read through technical details. The best engineers are the ones who read through those technical details and understands those nuances.
  - I agree though in that businesses don't care about code craft. They have other priorities - and it boils down to being able to make money (in a for-profit anyway).

### Highlighted Videos

One creator I didn't know I was missing from my life was Van Neistat. His philosophy about the spirited man really speaks to me in a way I wish I found earlier. One of his videos surfaced about screws. It's not a comprehensive look at them more than a practical one. I spent a lot of time with my dad at Home Depot, and screws have always fascinated me on our 3-hour long trips there.

Also from Colin and Samir interviewing Van. On why digital tools don't translate for him. His brain is wired different.
