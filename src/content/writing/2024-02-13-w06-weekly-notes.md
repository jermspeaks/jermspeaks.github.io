Solidifying my Weekly Review Template has been extremely useful. It reminds me what's important and what's not, and putting the reasoning as to why I put a task on my weekly review.

I found a YouTube short about this woman who lost her job, and her reaction was to be happy. Like of course it's going to garner views, and she even admits it's not the normal reaction people have to being fired.

Last week, I learned there are three [curiosity attractors](https://nesslabs.com/curiosity-attractors). Curiosity Attractors are the recurring fascinations that you can't shake, whether active or latent.

1. **Epistemic curiosity** refers to your desire to learn about the world and resolve gaps in your understanding
2. **Empathic curiosity** relates to your interest in connecting with others, understanding their perspectives and experiences
3. **Diversive curiosity** is that fleeting urge you sometimes feel to explore something new just for the sake of novelty, with no clear goal in mind

   > Curiosity attractors also often intersect with parts of your **identity**. We go back to questions that fit with our personal values and worldviews

- I learned from [Scott H Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com) that from these three models of learning, the model that appears to be best fit is based off differing prior knowledge. Even for a beginner, they do learn a lot, even if it's still not as much as someone who came in with a lot of prior knowledge (and they get benefit too)
