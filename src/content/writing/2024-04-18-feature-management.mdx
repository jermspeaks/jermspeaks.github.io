## What is Feature Management?

A **feature flag** is a decision point in your code that can change the behavior of your application.

<div class="sm:flex sm:gap-4">
  <div>
    <b>Temporary flags</b> are often used to safely deploy changes to your
    application or to test new behaviors against old ones. After a new behavior
    is being used by 100% of your users, the flag is intended to be removed.

    <b>Permanent flags</b> give you a way to control the behavior of your
    application at any time. You might use a permanent flag to create a
    kill-switch or to reveal functionality only to specific users.

### Feature Flags Are _Context Sensitive_

The code path token can change based on the context provided; for example, the user's identity, the plan they've paid for, or any other data.

### Feature Flags Are _Deployment Agnostic_

Feature flags can be used to control which users can see each change. This decouples the act of deploying from the act of releasing.

### Use Cases for Flags

- **Release** - A temporary flag that initially serves false to all targets, then progressively rolls out true to targets until it reaches 100%
- **Kill Switch** - A permanent safety mechanism used to shut off non-core functionality or third-party tools in an emergency
- **Experiment** - A flag to test a hypothesis and provide continuous optimization using beta users and A/B tests
- **Migration** - A temporary flag used to migrate data or systems while keeping your application available and disruption free

These are the ones advertised by LaunchDarkly. There are many more use cases, and they allow for customization.

## What is LaunchDarkly?

- LaunchDarkly is a company that provides **feature flags as a service**.
- At work, flags are served and managed by LaunchDarkly's services.
- LaunchDarkly is integrated through streaming via web sockets, meaning each web app user session receives messages only when necessary. Changes can be pushed out to clients in real time.

## How I use flags in practice

In our codebase, we have a custom React hook wrapped around the SDK
that returns the flag value that we can use programmatically.

```js
const [specificFlag] = useFeatureFlags([
  {
    flag: "specificFlagKey",
    defaultValue: false,
  },
]);
```

From here, we usually add conditional logic to toggle the flag logic to the target code.
We can also use the same method to do the same on the server-side as well.

### Adding User Context

LaunchDarkly uses context to target which flags should be on or off. 
The user's context, known in LaunchDarkly as identity, must be used when initializing the application.

#### Anonymous Users
On initialization, a user session will be identified as an anonymous user. 
This is because in the initialization, the user's session token (access token) has not been verified yet. 
Because we want to use flags for public users as well, i.e. those not logged into the app, we initialize the Provider before the token check.

An anonymous user has two attributes: 

- **key** - a unique identifier for the anonymous user and a field on the ldUser type.
- **anonymous** - a field on the ldUser type that notes if a user is anonymous or not. Stored as a Boolean.

#### Authenticated Users

Once the user authenticates, and the application has retrieved the user context, 
we identifies the user using the `ldClient.identify` function. 
In this identify function, we pass along the following information about our user:

- `key`: Our user's unique identifier (as a uuid)
- `anonymous`: false
- `email`: the user's email address

In addition, we pass along some custom fields that we can use to narrow down the user's targeting.
This includes their role and their organization, since our app is a multi-tenant.

If this user has already been added to LaunchDarkly, their flag profile will be returned. 

If this user is new, LaunchDarkly will automatically create this user, create their flag profile, and be returned.

#### Logout

On logout, the application re-identifies the user using the `ldClient.identify` function. 
Since the application has a logout hook, we add a handler to identify the user to be an anonymous user again. 
This resets all flags to switch over for anonymous users. 

### When do we change our flags?

- **Per Release** - For each release, our release team has a list of flags to modify, including toggling targeting and changing rules and segments per rules.
- **On Market Support** - There may be a request to make a non-release changes. These include new customer onboarding and turning on a feature for an existing customer.

### Deployments

There are different types of deployments:

- **Canary Releases** - User groups who would like to opt in
- **Ring Deployments** - Different user segments at a time - e.g. beta or power users
- **Percentage-based Deployments** - Start with low percentage, then move to higher. For operational changes

Each of these can be implemented using feature flags.

Feature flags and blue/green deploys are complementary techniques. Although there are areas of overlap, each approach has distinct benefits, and the best strategy is to use both.

### Testing

It isn't necessary (or even possible) to test every combination of feature flags. Testing each variation of a flag in isolation (using default values for the other flags) is usually enough, unless there's some known interaction between certain flags.

Here's an example using jest and LaunchDarkly's mock testing library.

```js
import { mockFlags } from 'jest-launchdarkly-mock';

it('tests with the flag on' , () => {
  mockFlags({
    [FLAG_IN_QUESTION]: true,
  });
  // Write your test here
});

it('tests with the flag off' , () => {
  mockFlags({
    [FLAG_IN_QUESTION]: false,
  });
  // Write your test here
});
```

### Flag Maintenance

Cleaning up flags aggressively is the key to preventing technical debt from building up. There's no royal road to flag cleanup, but there are some processes that make it manageable.

A stale flag is a temporary flag that is no longer in use and has not been cleaned up. Too many stale flags are a form of technical debt and an antipattern that you should avoid.

At work, we follow a practice to do it prior to any major release. This is about every 3 to 4 months.

        LaunchDarkly has multiple fallbacks. If their CDN goes down, it goes to
        their service. If their service goes down, you can route it to an
        external service like their relay proxy. If all of those go down, then
        there will be cached results from the last sucessful response. And if
        this is a first time request, then a fallback default value is used.
