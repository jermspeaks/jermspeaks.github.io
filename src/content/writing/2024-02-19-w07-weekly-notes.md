I've been pretty active with the website updates. I thought it might do me a little good to start adding a short changelog to the website. This sounds like it will be different than my [now](/about/now) page.

### Around the Website

- Re-arranged the tags so it is better formatted in-line with the published date
- I finished reading [The Psychology of Money](/curation/books/2024-02-09-the-psychology-of-money/), so I've moved it accordingly
- The lindy library metadata has been expanded, and posts have been added to the main page. It has also been renamed to the timeless treasure trove
- I started a [content creator curation](/curation/creators/) that I'm going to start expanding
- I added another [TIL blog post](/blog/2024-02-15-til-regex-decimal-points/) that might become a more regular thing. I'm thinking of making its own section if I continue for a few more weeks
- Images were migrated to Astro assets, which help with the website performance. This should reduce the [cumulative layout shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/articles/cls)
- I started to dabble with the [technology tree and Plot.js](/project/2024-02-13-technology-tree/)
- I added my thoughts on [American Fiction](/curation/films/2024-02-15-american-fiction/)

I'm also coming up with more ideas of what to do next. I'm thinking about doing a microblog inspired by [Linus' stream](https://stream.thesephist.com/). I'm getting inspired from "From Jason" [Where Have All the Websites Gone](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/) and how he thinks we should trade in our linktree links with things that we like on the Internet. Hell, if I think about my own patterns, they used to be on curated link aggregators.
