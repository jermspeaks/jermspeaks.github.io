As part of [curations](/curation), I have added a [classifieds](/curation/classified) section.

As a kid, I love reading the classifieds in the SF Chronicle. It was an interesting time to see it in the advent of Craigslist. Of course, this is by no means an alternative to Craigslist. It is hardly a place for others to add classifieds. This is more like a personal space I can add a wall for you to tear a piece of paper like on those coffee shops for finding a gardener. Except it's more specific to my own tastes.

In the coming months, I plan to add much more to this. It's like a personal ad system that probably has better click through rates (jk). I loved [Metafilter's ads](https://faq.metafilter.com/130/How-does-advertising-on-MetaFilter-work) since they were more tailored to their audience. This is not a paid sponsorship or ad board. I don't get paid for this, at least for now. If I do in the future, I'll be sure to put my disclosures in the classifieds.

If you have any classifieds you want to share, feel free to [email them](mailto:jeremy@craftbyzen.com) to me. I'll review them personally for now.

And maybe in the future I can add a "missed connections" section. I love easedropping on people's first time dates, which have been plenty this past year. I plan on writing some short stories about them in the future.

Enjoy!
