I did a really big re-write of my contacts in my personal rolodex, which I covered as part of [a blog post I wrote recently](/blog/2024-03-11-personal-crm/). I was thinking about dissecting this further and exploring what next avenues to do with that. I was super curious what other people had to say about this topic, but it led to further discussion about how it relates to sales and marketing for their business. Or focuses on a specialized tool, like [Monica](https://www.monicahq.com/). I have a few notes about this that I could also share as well.

In other news, my sleep has been destroyed again by springing forward for Day Light Savings, and I can't seem to get to bed at a consistent hour. And I'm out of shape, as proven by running and biking again. Going full speed after stopping for a long interval was not a great idea.

### Notable of the week

- [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) - Gleam is a friendly language for building type-safe systems that scale!
  - Running on the battle-tested Erlang virtual machine that powers planet-scale systems such as WhatsApp and Ericsson, Gleam is ready for workloads of any size.
  - I went through the [language tour](https://tour.gleam.run/), and for the most part, it was straight forward. I learned about tail calls as recursion is used for looping.
  - Results are another thing I can't really grapple with yet. As well as the left-handed arrow syntax for `use`, but I'm sure if I work with some Erlang, it will make more sense.
- [Instagram as a dating app](https://time.com/6256719/gen-z-instagram-dating-app/)
  - I always wondered about that, especially when it came to "sliding into your DMs".
- [Interintellect](https://interintellect.com/)Â - Attend or host conversations online and offline. The art of the French literary salon reimagined.
