This summer ramped up slowly, then became scorching. And that comes with a [fire watch](https://www.watchduty.org/?utm_source=craftbyzen&utm_medium=email) warning. 90F/32C isn‚Äôt what I would call ideal, especially in dry heat. And a [high of 129F at Death Valley](https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/i-went-to-death-valley-to-experience-129-degrees/ar-BB1pNJZ5?cvid=1b9b97f92bde4a59827e436af09bd407&ei=18&utm_source=craftbyzen&utm_medium=email) is enough to make one wonder. We held a family and friends BBQ earlier this month that was well attended. Even with setting up a canopy for our guests, it remained hot to be around the yard.

### Around The Blog

I‚Äôve re-written the [home page](/) and [main](/curation) [pages](/blog) of the website. It has more of a feed form factor plus pagination. Also, updated content is now fed back to the top. This helps re-surface curation posts and project updates.

### Interwebs Highlights

I liked the new format I started last month of sharing 2 or 3 things I read over the past month, so I‚Äôm going to continue having that in the newsletter. Here are two things that have resonated with me.

- [The True Story of Hushpuppies, a Genuine Carolina Treat](https://www.robertfmoss.com/features/The-True-Story-of-Hushpuppies-a-Genuine-Carolina-Treat) by Robert F. Moss. It started with a general curiosity if Confederate soldiers had come up with Hushpuppies, and once you‚Äôre in the rabbit hole, you come out understanding the lore.
- [Consulting Firms Are the Early Winners of the AI Boom](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/technology/ai-consultants.html?unlocked_article_code=1.200._ADp.ZR_fZkNud6nj&smid=url-share). There‚Äôs an analogy floating around that you can compare AI to the Internet boom of the 90s. Except there are major differences, mainly cost. Training an AI model takes a lot of compute time, and getting to the next step takes Trillions of dollars. And with that investment, it‚Äôs not a given there will be a major difference between the current model and the next one. These consulting firms are selling slightly better workflows, but organizations aren‚Äôt getting the 10x delivery they were promised.

### Currently Reading

I‚Äôve started reading [Frostbite](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/551601/frostbite-by-nicola-twilley/) by Nicola Twilley, and it satisfies my curiosity. For example, large refrigeration warehouses is a cryosphere. Many people who start working in it quit before the end of the day due to the cold. And those who do stick it out get all sorts of sicknesses before their body acclimates.

That‚Äôs all I have for this month. Stay cool out there, and watch some Olympic sports.
