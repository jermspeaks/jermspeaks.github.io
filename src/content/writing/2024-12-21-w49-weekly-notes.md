### US Department of Transportation

I was watching an interview with Pete Buddigeg about the different transit programs

[Transit Costs Project – Construction Costs of Urban Rail Projects All Over the World](https://transitcosts.com/)

[Corridor Identification and Development Program | FRA](https://railroads.dot.gov/corridor-ID-program)

[Corridor Identification & Development Program](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e1f1bd55cfad489a859cc8905d0dad16) - This is the OG of program development

### Your own adventure

[You Exist In The Long Context](https://thelongcontext.com/) - Steven Johnson

- This is really interesting, creating an adventure game given the text of the book the author wrote about the fingerprinting system used in crimes back in the 1910s. I would **love** to simulate some other scenarios from history. Apparently, the author has done the same thing for the cuban missile crisis.

### Costco says bye bye to books

### Food Deserts

### Estimations

Dave Stewart - [The work is never just “the work”](https://davestewart.co.uk/blog/the-work-is-never-just-the-work/)

The visuals are great (and I won't reproduce here). It goes over what is beyond the implementation and how it's visualized.
