description: "Taking a break from the politics talk this week as there are too many things to be enraged about, we look instead around the technosphere. City walks, reading A System for Writing and coming up new ideas for my workflow, choosing boring technology, looking at new Claude dev and engineer, and how story points being pointless. Around the globe, we examine the 100 books of the 21st century, where the blogs are at, no more free weather reports, the Olympics costumes for summer 2024, and recreating Bell Labs today."

---

I'm leaving the politics short this week. It's been a ride for the past 2 to 3 weeks of non-stop politics news that I'd rather turn down the dial for. It's still there, creaking eerily as it demands its own attention to be gobbled by the monster it has become.

There's too much disdain for my tastes about which candidate is better, which one got shot, which one tries to show up for unity and instead tears down the other side like they are vicious animals. And the local news isn't all that much better, with news of [affairs](https://www.autostraddle.com/i-had-an-affair-with-my-college-dean/).

Instead, I went on a walk today to clear my head. This weekly notes of digesting whatever happened this week has helped me put a macro-lens around this. Even though the chaos of the moment-by-moment playback by social media might take up our eyeballs, I think it's the moments we step away from the screen and think about where we are help us form better opinions.

### Around the technosphere

I'm lumping back together all of the technie, AI, and tools for thought links. It's been too much to create all of these categories, and frankly, when I go back, I can easily search them using my website.

And speaking of website, I've reconfigured my main page so the tagline and some other things will be on the sidebar and the main content is front and center. I've lumped together the books, streams, writing, projects, and other curations in this manner.

- [City Walks Live](https://citywalks.live/) - Fun livestreams and long videos of people walking around streets around the world
- Henrik Karlsson - [How to think in writing](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/writing-to-think)
- Currently reading: [A System for Writing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D18J83VB) by [Bob Doto](https://writing.bobdoto.computer/)
  - It's making me reflect on my own note-taking and note-making processes and how to capture and refine the things that I read with my own thoughts. I think if I re-read Sönke Ahrens's book, [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Technique-ebook/dp/B09V5M8FR5/?camp=1789&creative=9325&linkId=891da1bd51bb4996052321caa069a587), I would also get some new ideas too.
  - I'm pretty good at the capture part, given how long my weekly notes are. What I struggle with are the ideas presented in the sources that I'm reading. One thing I desperately need to do is to process these and put them in their own source note correctly. Readwise did the syncing part where I take notes on the piece of media. The next part is the harder lift.
