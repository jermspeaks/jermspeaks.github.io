There's been a bunch of back and forth with shuttling our things out of our old apartment. As such, I have not been taking as many week notes for this week.

### PSA

The Atlantic - [Throw Out Your Black Plastic Spatula](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/10/black-plastic-spatula-flame-retardants/680452/) - I mean, I definitely grew up with them and used them throughout college until moving over to silicon ones. When one melted, I "noped" out of it.

### When to hold vs. keep

[ðŸŒ² Heuristics for Hanging on to Things - by Eleanor Konik](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/p/heuristics-for-hanging-on-to-things)
- Where is the balance between how much we capture and how much that we capture is useful?
- Some notes are returned to on a recurring basis, like cooking thanksgiving meals
- For all things digital, the heuristic is to store it in archive, as loss aversion leads to regrets if the file is lost forever. Examples: lost photos, notes, etc.
