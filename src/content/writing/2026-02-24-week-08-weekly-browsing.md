Here's the top few items that I wanted to share from this past week's finds.

[OpenClaw, OpenAI and the future](https://steipete.me/posts/2026/openclaw)

Peter Steinberger, creator of OpenClaw, joined OpenAI. See the [tweet](https://x.com/steipete/status/2023154018714100102).

[OpenCode | The open source AI coding agent](https://opencode.ai/)

I'm finally trying this out this week. I'll report back if I like it.

[An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me – The Shamblog](https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/)

I knew I read this one recently. Absolutely fascinating that it happened, and absolutely terrifying of where we're going next.

Steve Yegge talking about [The AI Vampire](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/the-ai-vampire-eda6e4f07163). The Agentic Anxiety is real.

[Radix UI vs Base UI - Detailed Guide](https://shadcnspace.com/blog/radix-ui-vs-base-ui)

Also something for me to explore. Headless UI components are all the rave.

[Why Designers Can No Longer Trust the Design Process - YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4u94juYwLLM)

A re-watch for me where Jenny Wen talks about breaking away from the common knowledge design process.

[Extract Value From the "Process" Layer of Your Notes](https://www.eleanoroohkonik.com/p/extract-value-from-the-process-layer)

I've got more to say about this one. I'm currently working through making my own process layer.

[Why Is My Smart Home So Fucking Dumb? - Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/why-is-my-smart-home-so-fucking-dumb-1684949715)

An oldie, but still a goodie.
