I've decided to share things that I've found throughout the week, curating for you. You will find things that have caught my attention, notes that I think are worth exploring, and thoughts that have been perculating.

- [Popular nasal decongestant doesn't actually relieve congestion, FDA advisers say](https://apnews.com/article/sudafed-decongestants-phenylephrine-pseudoephedrine-fda-0f140bafae9a500c5fba05fe764ecb66)
  - This includes anything with phenylephrine in it, including Sudafed
- [A Portrait of Tenochtitlan • 3D reconstruction of the capital of the Aztec empire.](https://tenochtitlan.thomaskole.nl/)
  - It's a really cool 3D reconstruction of what might have been the civilization at the time
- [EWG's 2023 Shopper's Guide to Pesticides in Produce](https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/clean-fifteen.php)
- TikTok - [Depression Support List](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8jK3mpT/)
  - Now the list is there for us to add to, revise, and to refer to! He feels more supported and capable in being supportive and actually helping and I feel more supported and, less depressed!

- [3 Habits of Emotionally Strong Couples](https://www.thefriendlymind.com/3-habits-of-emotionally-strong-couples/?ck_subscriber_id=2281973317)
  1. Assertive Requests
  2. Firm Boundaries
  3. Intentional Vulnerability

- I heard this quote on [a podcast](https://www.relay.fm/focused/186) in respect to creating. While there are things you can't control, it's your attitude to it that matters the most.
- Also, Justin Welsh has written enough where his "new" content is really an update to his old content. Hence, having a [730-day content library](https://www.justinwelsh.me/newsletter/build-a-content-library). I would love to aspire on my ideas like this, and refine, refine, refine.
- I've had Psyllium Husk on my counter for months, and I had no idea it's attracted the Ozempic crowd. Priya Krishna write about [A Centuries-Old Fiber Supplement Entices the Ozempic Generation](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/dining/psyllium-husks.html). Maybe it's time I open up my packets.
- I learned about the [Merlin Bird ID](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) app for bird calls
