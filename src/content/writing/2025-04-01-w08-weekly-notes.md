### Summary

This has been a catch-up week. We cancelled the dinner with Adriel, which I feel bad about. But in that, it's been trying to rest up. Morgan and I are more seriously talking about kids, so I need to start my research. The world feels more and more ablaze.

### Notes

It's sad the complete carelessness and wreckage this administration.

> I am resigning as artistic advisor to the NSO.

> Not for me.

> It's been a wonderful 8 years working with Kennedy Center President Deb Rutter, fellow artistic advisor Renee Fleming, and the entire NSO staff, encouraging thousands of fresh new audiences to appreciate symphonic music. Mostly, and above all, I will miss the musicians of our nation's symphony orchestra - just the best!

> I have this folder in my notes app called “hyperspecific media collections”, where I find a specific mood or topic I love and compile a media collection. They consist of book quotes, song lyrics, paintings, and scenes from movies or television shows. I love the idea that all forms of art and creativity are intricately connected, and seeing these parallels and similarities allows me to truly appreciate art.
