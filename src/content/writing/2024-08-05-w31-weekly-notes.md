A new version of [Ideaverse Pro](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/ideaverse-pro) came out and I spent the weekend configuring it. It's up now, and I'm getting used to having my setup change. While there's the obvious changes, like the new theme, there's more subtle changes, as treating some maps as collections.

### The Technium

- [There’s a TUI for that with Nick Janetakis (Changelog & Friends #53)](https://changelog.com/friends/53)
  - You can apparently open a CSV file with SQLite where you can use queries
  - [The CSV Virtual Table](https://www.sqlite.org/csv.html)
    > SQLite actually has a CSV mode, and in-memory mode. And then it also will take queries directly from the the command line, so you don’t have to go into like little SQLite UI, and do things from there.

React Conf 2024 made me realize that the Apple Event Summary Slides are called "Bento Slides". I updated the note to reflect that.

I've been trying to find this database for quite some time: - [Little Sis](https://littlesis.org/) . It's the journalism database for following the money.

The New York Times reports "[Racked by Pain, One Man Turns To a Far-Right Platform And a Right-Wing Miracle Cure](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/us/politics/far-right-miracle-cure-medbed.html?unlocked_article_code=1.-k0.7ez6.wX9hqU6spKix&amp%3Bsmid=em-share)". I think when it comes to pain, there is an itch to find any kind of cure, especially when Western medicine fails us. And combined with our bad faith actors in the right-wing groups, it's easy to find solace with them.
