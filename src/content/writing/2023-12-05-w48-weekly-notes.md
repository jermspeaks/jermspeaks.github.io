Post-Thanksgiving week was "short" in the sense that I was getting back into the swing of things. It's that holiday slump period where you don't care for more to happen. For me, the period marks a sense of reflection. Time to go outside in the cold and take a hard look at what this year has been like.

Here are some links that resonated with me.
