---

I've changed my weekly workflow. I've set it up personally for the past few weeks, and now is a great time to try this out. I haven't made the "weekly note" for almost a year now, because it got overwhelming. Instead, AI tools help organize this much better than what I can do. So let's try this out for a few weeks. Introducing: Weekly Browsing.
