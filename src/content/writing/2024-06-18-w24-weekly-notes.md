### Reflections

- Used `jscodeshift` that ChatGPT helped me to create to change `defaultProps` migration for React 19
- I skimmed through "[The Definitive Guide to Google Vertex AI](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/the-definitive-guide-to-google-vertex-ai-9781801815260)" from Packt Publishing by Jasmeet Bhatia and Kartik Chaudhary. The things I learned about RAG were added to my [new blog post](/blog/2024-06-18-rag/)
- I met some bird watchers at SJSU this week. Looks like those [City Hall Peregrine Falcons](https://www.sanjoseca.gov/news-stories/city-hall-falcons) are back.

### Podcast Notes

- [Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez sees AI’s pathway to profitability - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/24173858/ai-cohere-aidan-gomez-money-revenue-llm-transformers-enterprise-stochastic-parrot)
  - [Attention is all you need | Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3295222.3295349) - Aiden is one of the authors
  - [On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots | Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922)
    - Aiden doesn't think this danger is bad.
      > That’s more than just parroting back what you’ve already seen. I think that these models don’t just parrot back what they’ve seen. I think that they’re able to extrapolate beyond what we’ve shown them, to recognize patterns in the data and apply those patterns to new inputs that they’ve never seen before. Definitively, at this stage, we can say we’re past the stochastic parrot hypothesis.
    - Stochastic Parrots hypothesis
      > The claim of that paper is that these [models] are just repeating words back at us, and there isn’t some deeper intelligence. And actually, by repeating things back to us, they will express the bias that the things are trained on.
    - what does **stochastic** mean in AI?
      - In AI and machine learning, "stochastic" refers to a variable process where the outcome involves some randomness and has some uncertainty. It is a mathematical term closely related to "randomness" and "probabilistic" and can be contrasted to the idea of "deterministic." Stochastic processes and algorithms make use of randomness during optimization and learning, which allows them to avoid getting stuck and achieve results that deterministic algorithms cannot.

  - [AI for the Future of Financial Research | Brightwave](https://www.brightwave.io/)
  - Brightwave shared some tips on leveraging LLMs as Judges:
    - ![The judge model](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd863aad4-e0a0-4e8e-9685-af3e9b91c9b0_1118x860.png)
  - **Human vs LLM reviews**: while they work with human annotators to create high quality datasets, that data isn’t just used to fine tune models but also as a reference basis for future LLM reviews. _Having a set of trusted data to use as calibration helps you trust the LLM judgement even more._
  - **Ensemble consistency checking**: rather than using an LLM as judge for one output, _you use different LLMs to generate a result for the same task, and then use another LLM to highlight where those generations differ._ Do the two outputs differ meaningfully? Do they have different beliefs about the implications of something? If there are a lot of discrepancies between generations coming from different models, you then do additional passes to try and resolve them.
  - **Entailment verification**: for each unique insight that they generate, they take the output and separately ask LLMs to verify factuality of information based on the original sources. In the actual product, user can then highlight any piece of text and ask it to 1) “Tell Me More” 2) “Show Sources”. _Since there’s no way to guarantee factuality of 100% of outputs, and humans have good intuition for things that look out of the ordinary, giving the user access to the review tool helps them build trust in it._
    > It’s been clear in the last year that the half-life of a model is much shorter than the half-life of a dataset
