I'm planning on making a short post updating what my weekly reviews are looking like, updated for 2024.
Every year or so, I'll review my existing template and see what should be modified. It takes me a few times to get used to the format, many more months of thinking about what's working and what's not, and making slow incremental improvements. Look out for that soon.

Also, as mentioned last week, I spent some time updating my newsletter service. I migrated from TinyLetter to Buttondown, which you can [read here](/blog/2024-02-01-newsletter-announcement/).
