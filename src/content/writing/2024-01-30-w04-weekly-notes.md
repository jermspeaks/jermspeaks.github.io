The YouTube algorithm said, it's time to get into Chess, so that's what I dived into this week. I was introduced to [Anna Cramling](https://www.youtube.com/@AnnaCramling), whose YouTube videos were really interesting to think about the moves as they were happening real-time.

I remember one of times I visited New York and seeing the Chess Hustlers in action. There's something fascinating about trash talking while playing a game of chess, like in many other games like Poker or Hockey. There's also this intellectual pursuit of watching openings, mid-game, and end-game material that's just a wealth of knowledge, vs. studying tactics, which as a teenager appealed to me.

Anyway, I want to start playing again. What's your favorite way to play chess, online or offline?
