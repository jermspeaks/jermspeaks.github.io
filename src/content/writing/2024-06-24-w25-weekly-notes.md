> Be a cycle maker, not a cycle breaker  
> -- Jatee Kearsley, owner of [Je T'aime Patisserie](https://www.jetaimebk.com/) Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yk2eqRWzEA&list=LL&index=12)

This idea of forgoing cycle breaking to making new cycles, like being the first grad to your family, or running your own business. Jatee talks about being the first business owner in her family, and I loved her enthusiasm and spirit.

Reflection - I'm using these weekly notes to remind myself what I've been reading and consuming over the past week and reminding myself why these things are important to me. I've felt myself being pulled in too many directions, and the heading in this note help me understand what overall topics are interesting me as of late. Hopefully I want to string these together into more cohesive themes that I can thread from week to week.

  > Because of \[Google Maps\] global scale, even a small shift in maps routing from a seemingly-innocuous (and frankly very useful!) feature could create a reinforcing feedback loop with spatial inequality. Inadvertently diverting foot traffic from low-income streets to high-income streets takes revenue and potentially tax dollars from already struggling communities and funnels it instead to richer communities.

Someone mentioned in the comments how much research she's done in this experience and how that service has already flopped. The amount of research into this topic is nuts.
