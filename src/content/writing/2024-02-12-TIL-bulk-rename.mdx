I have a bunch of files I want to rename using the `rename` utility.

If you've installed the `rename` utility on your Mac, you can use it to mass rename files in the terminal. The `rename` utility typically follows a specific syntax, and it's quite powerful for renaming multiple files according to certain patterns or rules.

import Aside from '../../components/Aside.astro'

<Aside type="tip" title="Config">
To install `rename` on MacOS terminal, do the following
```sh
brew install rename
```
</Aside>

Here's a basic example of how you can use the `rename` utility:

```sh
rename 's/old_pattern/new_pattern/' files_to_rename
```

For my markdown files, I have the following

```sh
rename 's/-clearlabs//' *-clearlabs.md
```

When dealing with filenames that contain spaces, you'll need to escape those spaces in your command. Here's how you can do it using the `rename` command:

```sh
rename 's/ Clear Labs//' *.md
```

This command will remove the substring " Clear Labs" (including the space) from all `.md` files in the current directory.
