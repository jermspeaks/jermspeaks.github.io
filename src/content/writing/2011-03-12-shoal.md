At the dawn of the world, I take out my shovel  
And dig and dig and dig,  
Like the early pioneers would do  
finding resources that the earth lain  
And I continued throughout the entire day  
finding my own resources in order to live through the night.  
Oh how awful the night has become  
With the crawlers and creepers infested over the twilight land  

But alas, day is not their time  
and I must collect as much as I can  
Except for shoal  
Unbearable, unspeakable shoal  
Oh, why has the creators invent such a useless resource  
Neither coal nor sand  
It can not be crafted for other purposes  
Your so close to being obsidian  
I can't even bear to carry one around  

But that's where I was wrong

I had not noticed said shoal  
upon my inventory or belt  
And there appeared only my sword, my axe, and tree bark  
But twas the nightfall  
Shoal was present, and I did the most respectable thing  
I threw it out hastily  
And it wobbled up and down  
spinning around  
Dancing upon the pixelated ground floor  
Why have you forsaken me, ole shoal  

"Out and away with you, I'll tear you apart!"  
My anger said  
And I took the shoal with me to the depths of the mines  
Where lava was to be found  
And that's not all I intended  
I'll find all of the shoal in the world  
And burn them too!  
That way I'll never have to see one again  
But it wasn't easy;  
the shoal had disappeared  

The anger has flustered me to no ends that I made a huge mistake  
I was in the wrong home  
Well not even a home but an open cave  
Open for the dark lurkers intending to do me harm  
And I rushed out into the dark despair  
Running as fast as I could to Hideout D  
So I took off, trying to avoid as many enemies  
But in no time, I was surrounded  
And I had a dull blade and no back-up supplies  
So I did the most logical thing  
And I dug as fast as I could  

The shovel took me as far down as another cave  
And I once escaped my enemies  
But now I was in another enemy territory  
With only one light to illuminate my space  
And I heard groaning in the seemingly still space  
"A creeper," I thought  
The noise grew louder and louder  
And I just stood there. Afraid.  

As the acrid sound touched my ear drum  
I felt fear, and other tingling sensations  
How was I so powerless  
Not being able to defend myself  
It was unbearable; but I didn't want to surrender  
I saw the creeper and I leapt away as it noticed me  
It charged toward me and then  
And then, and then, the end?  

Shoal came from the hole I dug earlier  
And landed on the creeper  
Exploding on impact.  
Shoal split into a thousand pieces  
And it disappeared  
Before my very own eyes  
Thank you shoal  
For saving my many lives  
I take back everything I said in the past about you  
I take back all the times I left you hovering in those caves  
Shoal, I liked our time together  
And you have a purpose  

Morning came, and I escaped the cave  
Going back to HQ for resources  
Carrying with me a bag of shoal  
For safe keeping.
