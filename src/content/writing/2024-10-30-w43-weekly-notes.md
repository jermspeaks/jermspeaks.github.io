I changed up the format last week. In a way, it's a little more freeing because I don't have to group everything with like things, necessarily. Plus, it gives me a chance to play around with looser organization.

With everything we have to move, most of my time and efforts at home at spent on that and not on the blog. Which makes sense - life sometimes has other priorities.

### Conferences IRL

Local Ghost - [You should go to conferences](https://localghost.dev/blog/you-should-go-to-conferences/?utm_source=changelog-news)

My general rule is to go to one in-person conference a year, if possible. I've certainly met my quota this year with !!Con. There are some I think I want to go to next year if possible, but of course, travel is a lot of work too.

### Recommendation Corner

Two books cropped up this week

1. [Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage](https://www.amazon.com/Endurance-Shackletons-Incredible-Alfred-Lansing/dp/0465062881/ref=asc_df_0465062881/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693033695460&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=9437998437457666889&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061321&hvtargid=pla-433973059586&psc=1&mcid=035635b5f8bf35f48d7ed4ab3addee30) by Alfred Lansing and Nathaniel Philbrick
   - This came up because there's this YouTube channel I started exploring about going to speed running every BART station stop. The current time to beat is 5 hrs 10 mins. I created my own wiki page to see how crazy this is and where people have attempted these riding challenges. Turns out, there are so many. Also, this book is a reminder in creating challenges for ourselves.
2. [Never Play It Safe: A Practical Guide to Freedom, Creativity, and a Life You Love](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Play-Safe-Practical-Creativity/dp/0062879995) by Chase Jarvis
   - I've read at least one of Chase's book

And one newsletter
