### Summary

Mostly a return to work this week. We ended the week going to a vinyl night at our local coffeehouse. And doing yard work during the weekend, leading up to the housewarming.

### Notes

I've discovered a way in Obsidian to make it possible to create these notes much easier using a feature called transclusion. That's where you can [link the contents of one note to another](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search#Embed+search+results+in+a+note).

I found a redditor who did this for their monthly review reviewing the summaries. I'm hoping this weekly review process helps me out.

Birding! I loved Ed Yong's XOXO talk that I wanted to read through this article and get started with birding.

- [Opinion | When I Became a Birder, Almost Everything Else Fell Into Place - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/30/opinion/birding-spring-merlin-ebird.html?unlocked_article_code=1.kk4.anFG.3BhelL2DS2-6&smid=url-share)
- Yong talks about how to be a public persona both online and off-line. How do you behave and act around people who are trying to reach out to you? How do you mute them all because it can always feel like a floodgate?

Khan Academy now has a financial literacy course that I want to take!

This comedian reflects on how much focus time is spent on social media work like reels, shorts, and TikTok. That's a full time job instead of working on the art (comedy in this case)

Two from Sam Altman on reflecting about the year, and a Bloomberg focus on interviewing him. The reflection is about 2 years of ChatGPT.

I took a slow dive into RISC-V, which use an architecture that Framework is spearheading. If true, this could be huge in making modifications in the future where we only need to upgrade a little bit at a time. And can still be performant for a work machine. More to come.

Add this to the Zuckerberg Czar comment, and we're right on track. I've heard it before and I'll echo it again. Facebook doesn't care about our privacy or trying to do good. That's a fact. They are in the profits business.

"How I program with LLMs" - which helps me with understanding how I could be using LLMs as well. Really, there's three ways this developer does it: autocomplete, search, and chat-driven programming.

James Altucher writes about writing down 10 ideas a day. I think I used this for Idea Generation in the past. I don't think generating ideas has been my shortfall. It's the necessary follow-up required.

Flexoki is this color palette generator of sorts that fits with the Tailwind scheme of 50 step increments. The output is specific to prose and code, so the colors are simply put for those aspects.

Nick Milo's failed year of sustainability

Work in terms of complexity versus complicated.

- ==Complexity refers to something that is hard to control and predict, while complicated refers to something that is difficult to understand==.
- Complicated might require a lot of parts, but it is knowable. Complex is not knowable.
