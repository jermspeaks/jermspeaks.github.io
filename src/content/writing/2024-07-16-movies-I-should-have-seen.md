---

I had a running list of movies that I made years ago, probably around 2010, that I wanted to watch. I've updated it a few times. Since then, I've moved my watchlist around so many times, I can't find them anymore. Some have been lost to the ethers of the Internet's walled gardens like my old Netflix watch list. Some movies I started but never finished.

Some are top movies, some are recommendations, some are the ones you see on everyone's lists, but I still haven't made the time to watch them all. And we all know - we will never watch them all. There's too much media to consume.

I'll be compiling this in a much long, sorted list that I want to make more interactive. 
This is part one. More to come.

<!-- ### A Much Needed Update, or Honorable Mentions

In that original list, there are so many movies that I know I want to watch that
somehow got overlooked when I was rattling movies off the top of my head. I know
this list is just an endless pit. I'll leave this for honorable mentions that
should have caught my eye back then.

- Alien
- Aliens
- Graveyard of the Fireflies -->
