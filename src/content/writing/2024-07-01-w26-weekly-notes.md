I've changed the process in how I write these by placing all of the day's note into this note and curating out the pieces that are clear they won't make it to these weekly notes. It's due to the random things we look up on a day-to-day basis that don't matter on the weekly cadence. And it goes to show how much we leave out once we are done with our curation.

### Personal Learning

- I've been trying to understand jscodeshift as React 19 is around the corner. With the help of Claude (and a little of ChatGPT, although their model was a lot worse) to explain how to crawl the AST. I wrote a [stream](https://craftbyzen.com/curation/stream/#2024-06-26t202336601z) about the trouble I went through

  - It may depends on how discretionary and direct agencies have to be for it to be explicit vs implicit regulation.
  - Or, we could always have those agencies not listen to the court ruling and continue as they are operating until other court cases appear.
