### In the margins of books

In the book on how to read a book (Mortimer and Alder), here's some strategies they employ:

1. _Underlining_ - For me, it's highlighting the lines that resonate with me
2. _Vertical lines at the margin_ - Honestly, this isn't something I run into for underlining a multi-line passage because highlighting using a digital book is a lot easier
3. _Star, asterisk, or other doodad at the margin_ - This is the step after highlighting to determine which pieces of highlights continue to resonate after the first insight.
4. _Numbers in the margin_ - Originally to indicate the sequence in which an argument is developed, might be a good notation for anything subsequent enforcing an argument.
5. _Numbers of other pages in the margin_ - This is making reference to another highlight. Some people use `Cf` to be a "compare from". It's a reference mark.
6. _Circling of key words or phrases_ - This serves much the same function as underlining.
7. _Writing in the margin, or at the top or bottom of the page_ - the words or notes around the books. This could be questions and answers (like Oxford notes), the major points, reflections, related to other pieces of writing.

I finally bought Anki, and looking at different ways to make the flashcards better. I'm at the rote memorization phase of learning Mandarin, so I've been figuring out what content to put on there, especially to help with grammar, word position, and vocabulary. I'm starting to graduate from words to coming up with my own sentences.
