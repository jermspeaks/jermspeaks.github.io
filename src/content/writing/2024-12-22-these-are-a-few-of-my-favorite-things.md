### Music

My friend and I create playlists for recapping the year. My specific rules for this playlist is to have it be at most 90 minutes, which is the length of this CD. And this has to have been released in 2024. There's a few gotchas, such as re-issues, re-releases, remixes, etc. I try to make it generally the original release, but that doesn't always workout. And sometimes I want to change the list after the end of the year.

Spotify - [2024 Curiously Curated](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0zoPVNOvFf4lFnk2eFpraA?si=38936fad8e9f44ca).
