This week marked a transition with my PKM where I made huge updates to my vault thanks to the [Ideaverse v1.5 migration](https://community.linkingyourthinking.com/c/ideaverse-pro/sections/143286/lessons/502483).

- I'm slowly migrating away from the PARA flow, although it will be a long time until resources and archive are going to be migrated
- A huge lift is thanks to some script automation that Claude has been helping with. Many scripts are going to be saved and added to my [magic sand](https://github.com/jermspeaks/magic-sand) repo.

Currently Reading: [Burn Book](https://www.amazon.com/Burn-Book-Tech-Love-Story-ebook/dp/B0CF72742R?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.XG3DBU2Hwxsjo3rxaWWreux9tW5LwTGVPI8W9usi_61xQaED7oc8JiZSFH77HOtXacFN7wbdZI1iZO9OKjxZFWpNEwmiklC6A61uTvYhuXK6tr5ILXHoAvkQNGmoOjsZXY4TNdSpXlYmrzVCxjrbdq8C1sjZWdxx5ssmEvYaGThW6Cm9p3h_J4eojchfBht7e52Gf2pcPx1C2stxE554aznCU8A-IM9clasyP0fV--jkw3xR7oq3J5G2kNjzGVOKKTnUCLWIBpLL6HHhB3XBX4203z1ufKePtL3RPWzbs8E.pupcMCuxsQOUfzmQcNCF_DJIPts4zUz7ax31HHo1cEc&dib_tag=se&keywords=burn+book&qid=1723481332&sr=8-1), by Kara Swisher. If you live in Silicon Valley and have wanted to know inside baseball with the elite who are in the area or are influencing the area, this is the book to read.

Also Reading: [Frostbite](https://www.amazon.com/Frostbite-Refrigeration-Changed-Planet-Ourselves-ebook/dp/B0CJTKZCTR) by Nicola Twilley

- The UK sent out a decree in the 1850s that stated protein is the only nutrition that matters affected the landscape of what Britain's ate. The slaughter of animals meant that there was a huge push to try to transport livestock to the cities transitioning to dead stock, this is had a crazy amount of effect. No one anticipated these early globalization efforts.

Quests involve overcoming internal obstacles ("dragons") and lead to personal growth and life-expanding rewards.
- [Intel’s Immiseration - by Babbage - The Chip Letter](https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/intels-immiseration)
  - Intel's financial results were very poor, with declining revenue, margins, and earnings.
  - Intel is planning significant job cuts to reduce costs.
  - Intel's turnaround plans are still in the early stages and have not yet shown significant results.
  - Intel's failure to diversify beyond its core x86 processor business is seen as the root cause of its decline.
- [My Failed Personal Site Redesign - Jim Nielsen’s Blog](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/my-failed-peronsal-site-redesign/) - Jim Nielsen describes his failed attempt at redesigning his personal website. He was inspired by the comic-book style of Anh's website and the large "DAVE" hero text on Dave's homepage. He went through several iterations of the redesign, experimenting with hand-drawn comic strips and different layout approaches. However, he never got the design to a point where he was fully satisfied, especially on mobile.
  - Ultimately, he decided not to ship the new design and instead kept his existing website. But he archived the work he did as a blog post for posterity.
