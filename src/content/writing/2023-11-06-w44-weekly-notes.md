### Personal Notes

- I've put my dad's 30 day notice for senior living in today. He's ready to go home around Thanksgiving time. He's ready to go him.
- My dad's health is generally okay. He's having some skin problems at the moment from not putting on enough lotion. His hygiene is terrible, and we are wondering if he needs to shower every day. He also is not shaving. We had dim sum yesterday, and are ready for other caretakers to help take care of him.
- His recovery is stagnant. We want him to interact with more of the people. I'm starting to create a recovery team for him so he has support

### Back to your regular notes

- I'm looking into a way to embed songs to Obsidian so I can link a song. I might use a YouTube embed in the meantime.
- Here's a note I wrote about my LYT showcase.
  - I recognize perfection is the enemy of good. And the way I've wanted to present my work is hardly how it looks when I'm in the middle of the idea. In my writing, first drafts hardly resemble the published draft. And even the published draft may be upcycled to other ideas. I'm very happy to see many other students embrace the mess
