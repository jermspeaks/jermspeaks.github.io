- [The Era of 1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764)
  - 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) focuses on the innovative approach of quantizing model parameters to ternary values to achieve efficient performance comparable to traditional 32-bit models.
  - We explored the rationale behind moving towards smaller, more efficient LLMs, driven by environmental, economic, and deployment considerations, and the potential for these models to operate on consumer hardware.
  - Through analogies, we illuminated how quantization and stochastic quantization work to maintain model performance despite reduced precision, akin to summarizing a vast collection of books into single sentences that capture their essence. These discussions underscore the balance between efficiency and performance in the evolution of LLMs.

- The Swyx Mixtape - [Serena Colyer - Intentionality](https://mixtape.swyx.io/episodes/serena-colyer-intentionality)
  - Summary: The podcast transcript explores the concept of intentionality in depth, as discussed between the host and their guest, Serena Collier. Intentionality is presented as living life with purpose, direction, and a conscious choice to pursue what one truly desires. It involves having taste, standards, and a vision for what one wants their life to be, alongside the determination to achieve it despite potential setbacks or failures. Practicing intentionality means creating a personal set of standards and desires, and actively making choices that align with those standards and desires to shape one's life according to one's personal vision. It's about making deliberate decisions rather than going through life passively, and it requires resilience, tenacity, and a willingness to confront challenges and discomfort for the sake of personal growth and fulfillment.
