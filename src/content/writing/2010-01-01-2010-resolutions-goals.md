Last year, I failed miserably with my goals. So this year, /i will try and succeed with at least half of my goals. Here we go.

1. Retain some other English accent  
2. Take an Art or Photography class  
3. Participate in a Marathon and train for it  
4. 52-Week Book Project. Check [this blog](https://52books.tumblr.com/) out for more info.  
5. Finish a collection of short stories  
6. Make a 365 Photo-Blog. I’ve started with Day 1 on this blog already. I should have the blog up by next Monday. The goal is to post a picture a day.  
7. Watch and take notes on every [Ted Talks](https://www.ted.com/)  
8. Watch 1 Movie a Week I’ve never seen before that’s been recommended to me. I’ll start this on the first complete week of 2010.  
9. Finish an Art piece and sell it.  
10. Write a song, possibly a whole EP, record it, and play it live.  
11. Keep a dream journal and experiment with lucid dreaming  
12. Participate in [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/)  
13. Continue blogging here  
14. Study history of pop music: done best by listening to 2 or 3 albums a week  
15. Tweet everyday with a new vocab word (Probably for [artwiculate](https://artwiculate.com/))  
16. Write a screenplay for a short film or web-series  
17. Write a proposal to pitch to VCs (or other people) of a live broadcast studio at low costs on the internet  
18. Reach goal of [100 podcast reviews](https://podcastsdaily.wordpress.com/) (I’m around about 60 now)  
19. Read David Allen’s [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) and implement it in my daily routine  
20. Master a different language  
21. Make a home-brewed electronic device  
22. Pass my GWR  

So I’m hoping to do at least 11 of these goals by the end of this year.
