With the protests happening on US university and college campuses, I want to give some time and pause to reflect on what's going on nationwide. There's a lot of political discourse and turmoil over the past month, and I might mix some politics with the next few weekly notes.

Note: this week and next week my notes might be late due to some last minute wedding planning.

- The Guardian - [How Neopets’ nostalgic revival tripled users in six months](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/14/neopets-revival-millennial-gaming-nostalgia?utm_source=tldrnewsletter) - I did wonder if my Neopets have survived since 2001. One has to wonder, and I no longer have access to those accounts.

Here’s a breakdown of his biohacking protocol and how much it costs (it’s WAY less than you think](https://twitter.com/maxhertan/status/1779968879697043804)
    1. Sleep - get 8 hours of sleep. No alarm. Previously using supplements: BIOOptimizers Sleep Breakthrough
    2. Exercise - Multiple times a day to remove cellular waste buildup and improve glucose and insulin regulation
        - BEMER (bio-electric-magnetics-energy-regulation) mat session to improve blood flow
        - Followed by circuit, then late morning CAROL (CARdiovascular. Optimization Logic) bike sprint, P90X, and TapoutXT for core
        - Evening balance board for body balance
    3. Nutrition - clean foods, proteolytic enzymes for enhanced digestion and nutrient absorption
    4. Supplementation - the man takes over 150 supplements daily. Holy crap!
        - [Dave Pascoe - My Supplement List](https://www.davepascoe.net/home/my-supplement-list)
    5. Limited environmental exposure
        - Filtered water and air
        - No toxins from daily use products, cookware
        - Limit exposure to exhaust, fumes, air fresheners, etc.
    6. Infrared Sauna - 25-45 minutes
    7. Cold Exposure - cold plunges and cold living spaces to reduce inflammation and improve immunity
