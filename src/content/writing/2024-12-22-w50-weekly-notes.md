### These are a few of the things that I learned

Tom Whitwell returns with [52 things he learned in 2024](https://medium.com/@tomwhitwell/52-things-i-learned-in-2024-75efffe44f15).

And adding this internal playbook (as a PDF) at Facebook called the [Red Book](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/wisereads/articles/facebook-s-little-red-book/FB_Red_Book.pdf)

And maybe for the first few weeks of 2025? [7 Databases in 7 Weeks for 2025](https://matt.blwt.io/post/7-databases-in-7-weeks-for-2025/?utm_source=tldrwebdev)

And of course, handhelds.

### What's up, Cal?

I've read a good chunk of Cal Newport's books over the years. He breaks down his own interests in [The Tao of Cal](https://calnewport.com/the-tao-of-cal/)

### Make Care Packages

I love the idea of creating care packages for friends and family. Christmas shouldn't be the only time you create gifts for people, so maybe call them care packages instead.

Might I recommend [First Bloom's Care Packages](https://c26808-93.myshopify.com/) as a starting point?

And on that note, I love themed gifts. Here's the one my wife and I use

- Something she _needs_
- Something she _wants_
- Something to _wear_
- Something to _read_

### Show me your home library

I came across a video breaking down the largest home library. I wasn't aware of the Loeb Classical Library, or other collections of the sort. The hoarding mind of mine would love to have a complete set. But who am I kidding. It's enough I have a good set of Criterion Collection films.

Speaking of books, I have been recommended Nick Milo's "How to work a book". Here's a short write-up of what to expect from the one hour course. [Books are for thinking, not reading](https://nickmilo.substack.com/p/books-are-for-thinking-not-reading?__readwiseLocation=)

### Goal Set and Start

Ness Labs - [Rethinking Goals: the Science of Nonlinear Goal Setting](https://nesslabs.com/nonlinear-goal-setting)

### A Different Advent

[12 Days of OpenAI | OpenAI](https://openai.com/12-days/)

Alongside that, some are talking about Google's new chip. [Meet Willow, our state-of-the-art quantum chip](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/)

### Notre Dame Re-Erected

The New York Times - [How Notre-Dame Was Reborn](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/europe/notre-dame-paris-france.html?unlocked_article_code=1.fU4.k3K8.pPWC4SUURR2C&smid=url-share)

### When is the right time?

I really love the depth Simon Willison goes into details like this where I've heard the debate from different angles and how he's able to consolidate them. [Storing times for human events](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/27/storing-times-for-human-events/?utm_source=tldrwebdev)

A different interpretation of time is place. And Ev William's new start-up wants to conquer lonliness. [Mozi: A Place For Your People](https://www.mozi.app/). See also, [The Myth of the Loneliness Epidemicâ€”Asterisk](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/08/the-myth-of-the-loneliness-epidemic)

### Maps across time

[TimeMap.org - World History Atlas](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/en/history/regions?_bhlid=bba32fa40e4aaa6a7992a02eaf1c0edea3c7edbc#position=2.863/31.04/82.05/-4.46&year=2011) - This has been an interest of mine to control the timeline and understand a map better. Or any other incident. Scrubbing, as they say.

### Changelog Spin-offs

[A new era for the Changelog Podcast Universe](https://changelog.com/posts/a-new-era-for-the-changelog-podcast-universe?utm_source=changelog-news) - three of their shows are getting spin-offs. Sounds like cut backs, but they are re-focusing, and I can totally understand that.
