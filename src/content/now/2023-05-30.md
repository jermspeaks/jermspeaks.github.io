Finishing up the book, "Laws of UX". It's a great primer on the topic and I'm looking forward to sharing it with my team. Also reading "Saving Time: Discovering a Life Beyond the Clock" by Jenny O'Dell.

Slowly moving to San Jose, California. The apartment has been finalized, and we have two months to move in. Also, planning my wedding for May 2024.

Deployed and continually making improvements to this website. I'm using Astro.js and re-learning Svelte along the way.

I'm nearly done with playing through Hogwarts Legacy.
