I have been making major website updates, and I've written about a few of them, 
including [curations](/blog/2024-01-26-curations), [classifieds](/blog/2024-02-20-classifieds), and my migration over to [buttondown](/blog/2024-02-01-newsletter-announcement/). I'm both scared and excited to write again on a monthly basis, or at least that's the cadence I want to build. For more about website updates, I'll do another post soon. I'll leave now for what's actually happening with me.

Since the last update, I've bought my suit for my upcoming wedding.

I'm still reading [How Infrastructure Works](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/612711/how-infrastructure-works-by-deb-chachra/) by Deb Chachra, although it's taken a back seat to [The Tools](https://www.thetoolsbook.com/) by Phil Stutz and Barry Michels. It's one of those can't put down books for me.

Since the last post, I've also watched [The Curse](https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/the-curse/) and [Poor Things](https://letterboxd.com/film/poor-things-2023/). Like my [anti-library](/curation/antibooks), there needs to be a section for books.

There has been a Reduction in Force (RIF) at my current company again, and while prospects for the future are high amongst the upper staff, it does breed some not-so-great sentiment around the mind and the office. I'm not in full panic and find a new job mode. But I do feel saddened for the people who have been let go.

I have an undisclosed project that I'm working on the side, but I don't want to reveal any details until it's final. I have a problem with talking too much, and not working on that project.

As for the things that have been interesting me as of late, I've been using [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/) for about half of my searching needs, and it's been extremely helpful for the research type tasks I've been investigating.

Ta ta for now! üé©
