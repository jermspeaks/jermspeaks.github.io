I've talked extensively about [my dad's health issues](/blog/2023-12-25-seasons-greetings/)
at length, so I thought it might be worth talking about other things that
I've been currently doing. It's a new year, and I'm prepping more writing for
2024, including a first entry elaborating my yearly theme, the "Year of Renewal".

I'm getting married this May! Most of my time is spent planning until then.
Otherwise, I'm chugging away working at Clear Labs, taking care of little Yuzu,
and finding any free time to have dates with my fianc√©e.

### Reading

I'm currently reading "How Infrastructure Works: Inside the Systems That Shape Our World"
by Deb Chachra. I absolutely loved her newsletter.

On that note, the next book after I finish that book is "Dust: The Modern World in a Trillion Particles"
by Jay Owens.

### Website updates

At some point, I plan on making a "curation" section, that will supercede my
"Lindy Library" and maybe collapse my books and films section. Undecided how it
will look. I absolutely love going to the library or bookstore and seeing blurbs
of small reviews, and I thought it would be lovely to show collections of found
items the same way.

Also, you may see more tiny projects on the website, much like my JSON editor of
last year. I'm loving [Make Real](/blog/2024-01-08-make-real), so I might use that
as a good prototyping tool.

### Watching

I've gotten some kudos from multiple people about my media [logs](/log). I'm
continuing to log my media for 2024, hopefully more comprehensive than last year.
There are still some movies I've watched that I have to parse from my fianc√©e's
watch history.

I have a bunch of new releases in my queue, including
[The Curse](https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/the-curse/),
[Poor Things](https://letterboxd.com/film/poor-things-2023/),
[The Boy and the Heron](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-boy-and-the-heron/),
[Afire](https://www.criterion.com/films/33797-afire),
and [Anatomy of a Fall](https://letterboxd.com/film/anatomy-of-a-fall/).

### Miscellany

I've been playing with the Anbernic RG35XX Plus, and I absolutely love it.
I've been able to play games I haven't gotten the chance to, including "A Link to the Past",
"Final Fantasy II", and many others. The emulation and controls are absolutely
everything I wanted, and more.

Happy 2024!
