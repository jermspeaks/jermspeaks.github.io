### Current Media

Currently reading: The Origins of Efficiency by Brian Porter

I've been reading his blog for the past year, and I was super excited to pick up his book this week. If you're going to buy it for digial, I recommend the [Kobo edition](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/the-origins-of-efficiency?sId=6ca397e5-0183-4e0c-8176-39fe39a72ede&ssId=KjSTzKZV-v5zTJn8mkiEB&cPos=1) since it's DRM-free (unlike Amazon).

We watched Sinners yesterday, and it's really incredible. I'm looking to overhaul my media log soonish. Given no updates on this website since the spring, it's hard to put any hard deadlines on this website. I still do weekly reviews, although incredibly personal. And I'm inspired by some other websites to do more short form, like Tumblr-esque, with new web paradigms.

For example, there's this blog roll viewer from [Jason Kottke's website](https://kottke.org/) called "kdo rolodex" that I really love and I want to create a widget like that. And I think having links with a card view with open graph data (especially images) will be more helpful.
