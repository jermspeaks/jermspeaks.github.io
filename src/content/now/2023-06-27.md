Every weekend, I've been slowly moving to San Jose, so I haven't been able to spend enough time with my hobbies and side projects. This website has seen a down tick in content, and I'm looking forward to writing more in the near future. Certainly post-move.

To spend the in-between time not thinking about code, I've been playing Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. We recently finished Cult of the Lamb, and it felt pretty special.

I went to the Figma conference last week at San Francisco Moscone Center, and it was a packed event. I'm excited to dive deep into more UX work.
