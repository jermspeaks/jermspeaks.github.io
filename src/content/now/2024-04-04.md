I've slowed down on the website updates and have focused more on projects and
writing. I think there's always a balance to strike with what more I could do
versus what really matters.

We have a little over a month until the wedding. The final details are being looked
at. When people tell me wedding planning is no joke, I can echo that sentiment.

We bought the Brooklyn Nine-Nine boxset and have been watching through the series.
Netflix has the first four seasons, but there wasn't enough closure for the remaining
seasons, and iTunes or Apple TV had a sale, so we've been putting that in the
background while we work on the wedding. It's nice to have something grounding.

As for books, I've been wondering if I should read "The Power Broker" by Robert Caro.
It's a monster of a book about Robert Moses. I was listening to 99% Invisible's mini-series
about the book, and it sounds intense.

I've been slowly making my way through Cal Newport's new book, "Slow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout" as well as Emily Nagoski's new book, "Come Together: The Science (and Art!) of Creating Lasting Sexual Connections".

My partner is starting to use [Capacities](https://capacities.io/), and I set up
an account to also try it out in tandem. There's a lot of good ideas in that app,
but I'm not sure I'm going to covert from Obsidian. I'm used to my tool, and I'm
probably going to stick with it for now.
