Svelte is a component-based JavaScript framework that compiles your code at build time rather than at runtime. This means that instead of shipping a bulky framework to the client, Svelte generates highly optimized vanilla JavaScript code that updates the DOM. This approach results in faster load times and better performance. Additionally, Svelte has a small API surface area, making it easy to learn and use.
