This year is the 2023 Year of Intention.

> Note: The "year of intention" is a [Yearly Themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE), a concept that [CGP Grey and Myke Hurley](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/136) came up with.

## Daily Notes

- This is for me to add links, thoughts, opinions, and ideas throughout the day

## Daily Start-up Tasks

- [ ] Add Yesterday to Timeline
- [ ] Order lunch for tomorrow
- [ ] Review Today's Tasks from the Things app
- [ ] Check Today's [Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/). Time block my calendar
- [ ] Review new overnight Slack messages
- [ ] Review incoming [emails](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox)
- [ ] New Tickets from JIRA
- [ ] Check updates from Figma
- [ ] Review all current projects
- [ ] Add an entry to "Day One" Journaling app
- [ ] Clear Drafts app Queue
- [ ] Mood Check
- [ ] Check "This day last year"

## Events / Interstitial Journaling

- I'll add my schedule, written down so I have a better grasp of it.
  - It's equivalent to writing it down on a calendar for the day. Helps remind me I have meetings coming up
- I'll also use this opportunity to interstitial journal to discover retroactively

## This Day In The Past

- I'll review my daily review from last year to discover any insights

## Mood Ranking

I'll rank my mood out of 10, which I review at the end of the week.
This helps me see even if there are down days, there will be up days in the future.

Share your daily routine! If you're systematic like me, I'd love to hear about it. If you free ball it, I'd love to hear from you too!
