We are back in our regular rotation. LYT Workshop 12 wrapped last week, as I mentioned in the previous week, so expect this to be more regular.

- I'm finally getting back to doing a quarterly review, a month later than I would've hoped.
- NaNoWriMo is starting this Wednesday, and I'm planning to participate. I put my [Project Page](https://nanowrimo.org/participants/craftbyzen-jeremy/projects) up for everyone to see.
- At work, we've been chugging along working on next product requirements that's hush hush here
- As some people are aware with [my father](/blog/2023-08-11-hospital-vibes/), we've followed up with PT this past week where he can start walking supervised without his cane, which is a win all around.
- [This new genome map tries to capture all human genetic variation](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/10/1072857/this-new-genome-map-tries-to-capture-all-human-genetic-variation/)

> Itâ€™s called a pangenome, and it could explain the DNA that makes each of us unique.

I'm super curious about the intersection of science and data visualization, so this might be something of a research area in my near term.

- I'm super curious when it comes to wedding tea ceremonies, as my wedding is coming up next year. I'll probably be going to SF Chinatown, after looking at [Photos: Inside a traditional dress shop in S.F. Chinatown](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2022/visuals/sf-chinatown-dragon-seed-clothing/).
- I've been returning to this idea about systems, and when I encounter new ones (tagged: experimental), I try to incorporate them in my own workflows and see if they mesh. Most do (I'm looking at you, GTD)

- An oldie, but goodie given I was doing a bit of research on what if I won that [recent $1.76 Billion lottery](https://www.powerball.com/draw-result?gc=powerball&date=2023-10-11)
  - [Congratulations! You just won millions of dollars in the lottery! That's great. Now You're F\*\*ked - r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vo34/comment/chb38xf/)
- As someone who lived in a house that had many elements of Disney themes, this article delights me in [how Disney fans make Disney-inspired home decor feel like magic](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/style/disney-home-decor.html)
- In lieu of the point above about systems, a tangent is the idea of mental models. Here are [10 mental models that make the modern world](https://twitter.com/oldbooksguy/status/1707421852128469147/?rw_tt_thread=True)
- [Netflix DVD is now over](https://www.theverge.com/23883662/netflix-dvd-shutdown-complex-tech-packaging-mail). However, I still love my physical media, even with storage constraints. [Changelog recently did an episode on physical media](https://changelog.com/news/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-physical-media-Y1YX) and lamenting the golden age of films
