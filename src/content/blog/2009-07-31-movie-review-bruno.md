# Movie Review: Brüno

## My Review (Rant) on Bruno

Not worth my time. That’s one phrase I’ll use to describe the movie. The movie is vulgar, eye-dropping, shocking… to expose genetalia to an extreme. Also, Sasha Baron Cohen makes Austria seem like Kazakhstan with more Hitler jokes. There’s some differences I found with Borat and Bruno:

1. Bruno is gay. Borat isn’t. Bruno engages in abscure sexual activities. Borat does the same, but with a woman.
2. Borat’s character got Sasha Baron Cohen sued by, well, almost everyone. Bruno probably won’t get Sasha Baron Cohen in trouble. But probably, someone will sue him eventually.
3. More gay jokes in Bruno, as well as generalization and stereotypes of gays. Borat was plain racist and stereotypes across all races.
4. You could actually look at Borat. With Bruno’s licentious, open style of clothing, I think I can agree with someone out there that there were times when I couldn’t look at Bruno. I’m not homophobic, I’m just not open to that type of strange fashion.

So what was good about the movie? Umm… That’s left for someone else to think about.

Bottom line: Did it make me laugh? Yes, but it didn’t leave me feeling like I should watch it again. If you’re into gay sex and naked people, as well as toilet humor, this is your movie. I’m not a fourteen-year-old kid, and I don’t think I’ll ever enjoy this humor again.
