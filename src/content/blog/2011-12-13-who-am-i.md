# Who Am I?

I realized after a few years of this blog that I really made no formal introduction of myself, and for that, I give you a blog post dedicated to who I am.

Hello, my name is Jeremy Wong, and here are a list of things that I do:

- I run this blog, [jermspeaks.com](http://jermspeaks.com/), and have since 2008.
- I also contribute (once in a while) to [The Documentary Group](http://docgroup.org/) on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)
- Learn more about the services I use on my [about.me](https://about.me/jeremywong) page
- Two defunct Tumblr pages I used to run, and may someday abandon: [Everything Clint](http://everythingclint.tumblr.com/) & [1 Album Everyday](http://albumperday.tumblr.com/)
- I’m a college student by occupation right now. The future is looking in all directions though, especially in the direction of a Master’s or Ph.D.
- Born and raised in California. Actually, still living in California in the lovely and sunny Central Coast.
- Ran a daily show that really was not that great looking back: [The Daily Jerm](https://vimeo.com/album/48089)
- [Podcast Reviewer](https://podcastsdaily.wordpress.com/), now defunct. Got tons of traffic though, and still get annoying requests to review podcasts

Here are some upcoming projects I will be working on:

- The Bible: RPG, a game that circles around the biblical story from Genesis to Revelations, and doesn’t skip a beat on every account of rape and pillaging (and will play out as a parody to the Good Book).
- Writing a short webseries about the Happiest Place on Earth, and how it might not actually be that happy (hoping for dishing out six episodes of well produced laughter).
