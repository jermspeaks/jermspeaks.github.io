title: Navigating Healthcare During Crisis
---

My dad fell from the roof. It was 10pm, Friday night, July 7th, 2023.
It's the call you never want to receive. I was about to get ready for the dog's
last walk, then get ready for bed. Instead, I rushed over to Highland Hospital in
Oakland.

Initially, it all seemed the head injury he sustained was minor.
A concussion, some bruising, not a big deal. Matters got worse when the second day
the nurse treated the family as if he knew better than the doctors. Forcing my dad
into a standing position, even though he complained of naseua and dizziness.
There was a lot of confusion, and the nurse thought he knew better than to ask
the doctor if my dad needed another CT scan ordered.

The next day, my dad was rushed into the operating room and the surgeon performed
a craniotomy. Within 24 hours, they stabilized his intercranial pressure and removed
excess blood pushing his brain to one side. It was a life or death situation, and
we were all praying for the best outcome. He was intubated for the next day, and
appeared barely there for the next few days. After being in the ICU that week, he
was moved to a step-down unit where he was under routine supervision for the next
week.

Reflecting on this messy situation, there are a few things I took away.

**Don't take the nurse's or doctor's word**. If someone you love is in critical care, you are the
first observer, especially if you are there 24/7. Having family members help in
shifts are really important, as you can cover as much time as possible.

**Seek out the patient advocate**. If things aren't going well, like the doctor's
not listening, or the nurse has become combative, every hospital has a patient
advocate. It may take time to dig up their information, but in the end, having
someone who truly cares for patient safety can be the difference between life and
death.

**Don't be afraid to ask questions**. Although I might be an outlier in the amount
of medical knowledge I have, I still ask questions, even qualifying ones. It's
important to understand which medications are being administered, and why. It's
important to know when the nurse shift change is. It's important to know when your
loved one will be discharged. Much of what I've learned in the last month has helped
me navigate what shouldn't be such a complex healthcare system.

There are some base assumptions I'm making here if you're following this advice.

1. The critical care facility is in the U.S. Specifically, California.
2. Your loved one is in a life or death situation
3. You have others helping you (makes it a lot easier)

I hope I'll never have to come back to this note, but in the worst case scenario,
I would have loved to read this advice.
