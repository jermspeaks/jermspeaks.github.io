# Book Review: Cradle to Cradle

![cradle to cradle book cover](http://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m39ym2JUA81qz81kho1_250.gif)

This week’s book review is “Cradle to Cradle” by William McDonough & Michael Braungart. The book calls for looking at the manufacturing a product from the resources to product to waste and to really make an effort to get rid of its flaws. First off, the waste = food is quite a good way of summing up the main theme of the book, and how it’s really difficult to get to that point.

The authors really understand how this is incorporated in design, and decided to create an entire foundation with this concept in mind. [MBDC](http://mbdc.com/c2c-certified/) was created to deal with these problems and give better solutions than the disposable product society we’ve become. There’s a bunch of science involved to it, from chemicals to ecology, but it’s nothing too hard to understand.
