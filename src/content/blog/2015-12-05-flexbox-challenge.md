This is a review of [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/), a game designed to help you learn about flexbox through moving frogs to their lily pads.

```css
// In your flexbox, you have centered the content horizontally
// centered with "justify-content" and vertically centered with "align-items".

.pond {
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
