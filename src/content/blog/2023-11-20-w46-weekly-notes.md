I use a version of a resonance calendar, but it's more like what sparks. I put it in my notes, wait a day, and see if I'm still interested. Time is usually my best filter.

> The idea of a Resonance Calendar seems to have come from [the community surrounding the notetaking app Notion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYBB-Uw1IM&ref=eleanorkonik.com), but awhile back I adapted it for my own uses and I’ve found it really useful as a casual periodic practice. The idea is to keep track of and reflect on the various things that you read, watch and listen to. I used to go back over what I read and review the summaries I wrote about why I bothered, but I fell out of the habit as my pregnancy progressed.
