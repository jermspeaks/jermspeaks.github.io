This week’s book: “How to be Black” by Baratunde Thurston. As an ethnic minority (i.e. not white in the US), there are a few things I could really relate with. The book is a great template for knowing what it means to be black, not how to become one. That isn’t possible if you’re not born into it. For me, I now understand how we aren’t actually in a “post-race” society because the US citizens elected a black president. Also, I understand the humor in how being black can be used to mess around with people. The biggest thing that the book has helped me with is to get a grip on identifying that I’m an ethnic minority (or if you’re black, identifying you’re black). I read the book during February, during Black History Month, so that’s probably a good time to read it. It doesn’t mean you absolutely have to (because now it’s March).

Lastly, since I come from an Asian background, there’s Asian school on Sundays to appreciate where we come from, how our culture ties into the US, and learn a foreign language. There isn’t this type of school for black people in the US, and the book calls for something like that. The book includes some stories from a panel of experts on blackness (the core of which is mixed races, but primarily black people). I glad I shouldn’t feel bad for saying the phrase “Black People.”
