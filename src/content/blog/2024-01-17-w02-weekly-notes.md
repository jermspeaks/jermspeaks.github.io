> Containers didnâ€™t just lower the cost of shippingâ€”they all but eliminated it. Transportation costs became negligible, no longer a barrier to worldwide distribution.
> -- Deb Chachra, How Infrastructure Works, Chapter 3: Living in Networks

I've been taking a slow burn reading Deb Chachra's new book, "How Infrastructure Works". It's the book I wanted [The 99% Invisible City](https://99percentinvisible.org/book/) to be. It's a nice compliment to it, and dives deeper into the idea of how networks dominate our everyday lives in a (sometimes) hidden way.

At some point, expect this book to be in my book list.

Also, a quick update about the website. My library will be changing. I'm working on a "Curations" page that will replace it, as I want to extend it to be a gallery of found things. It's like all of those tiny European museums that have trinkets and things, but in a more digital, meaningful way. And if you have no idea what those are, maybe I'll write about it in the near future.
