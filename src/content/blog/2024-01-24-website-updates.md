## New Year, Combined Pages

I haven't given a website update since June 2023. Since some other things have happened, 
here's a short recap of some major updates.

- [Resume](/about/resume) updates
- [Writing](/blog) has expanded to adding weekly notes
- [New project](/project/2024-01-09-piano) added! âœ¨ Thanks Make Real!
- Combined many pages into a general "[curations](/curation)" page

### Bug Fixes and Enhancements

- Fix the relative links by removing on mobile and making classes
- about page layouts updated titles for indexing
- Added alt tags as figcaption (helps with attribution too)
- Add reading time to blog posts
- Upgraded to [Astro 4](https://astro.build/blog/astro-4/)
- Asides added as an Astro component
- Fixed the [RSS](/rss.xml) reader initial image post
