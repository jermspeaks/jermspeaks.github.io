In Astro, there's this concept of islands. You have a few options on making your page interactive.
From the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#using-framework-components),
these are your options.

```astro
---
// Example: hydrating framework components in the browser.
import DemoApp from "../../components/DemoApp.svelte";
---

<!-- This component's JS will begin importing when the page loads -->
<DemoApp client:load />

<!-- This component's JS will not be sent to the client until
the user scrolls down and the component is visible on the page -->
<DemoApp client:visible />

<!-- This component won't render on the server, but will render on the client when the page loads -->
<DemoApp client:only="svelte" />
```

I'll go ahead and try each of these and see what happens.

import DemoApp from "../../components/DemoApp.svelte";

## Example using client:load

<DemoApp client:load />

## Example using client:visible

<DemoApp client:visible />

## Example using client:only

<DemoApp client:only="svelte" />
