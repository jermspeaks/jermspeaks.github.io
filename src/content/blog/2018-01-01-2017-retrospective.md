This year has been tough. Stressful, hard to bear, testing my beliefs. Yet, for all the negative events, I still found time for finding myself and having a deeper understanding of life.

I have not come out publically to talk about my friend's suicide. It was painful. And then a ex-co-worker died. Then a family friend. Then my backpack was stolen. After that event, I crashed. My emotions got the better of me. I went hermit mode for a month, unsure if I could come out. But I'm reminded I have friends along the way, helping me through the tough times. I also have the option to seek grief counseling. The world can be cruel. The world can be delightful. Depends how you look at it.

So as I take the time this year to reflect on my list of accomplishments, I also reflect on the unexpected. Here's my list.

## The List

- I gave a speech at my friend's wake. I told a story about the last time we hung out. He told me a crazy story where he met a hangglider while hiking. The glider asked my friend if he wanted to try hanggliding. Of course, my friend accepted. The next day, he's harnessed with the stranger, and he said he felt so serene up in the air. He fell asleep for an hour. When he woke up, he tapped the stranger and told him how peaceful he felt. The glider said my friend was crazy.
- I traveled to St. Louis, Missouri, marking off one more state. 15 to go for my goal of all 50 states before 30.
<!-- - First time to France and Spain -->
- I wrote two series of newsletters. One on repeated failures. The other interviewing people about communication and connection.
- I went to New York within a month time-frame for two different conferences. I'm inspired to be submit a call for proposal for conferences next year.
- I watched more films this year.
- I attended too many talks and lectures to count, ranging from group biases to the history of women in the Black Panther movement.
- Attended the "Papers We Love" conference and got to meet some developers I always wanted to talk to
