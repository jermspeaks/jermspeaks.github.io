## Invididuals' Websites

These are people whose websites serve as awe and inspiration. There's something
that resonates with me and I want to emulate or remix ideas from their websites.
Some people I've met IRL, and I love their work. Others I might have met online.
And the rest are people I've stumbled upon.
