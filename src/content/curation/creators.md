The creators who have an influence on me. I love these people's work. They make wonderful things in the world, and I can't help but share a little bit of who they are and how they've had an impact on me. This goes beyond books, movies, tv, newsletters, podcasts, and YouTube channels. Each post is a reason they have a profound impact on me, and the things that they make, both online and IRL.
