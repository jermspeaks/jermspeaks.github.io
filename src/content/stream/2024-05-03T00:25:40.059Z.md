From The Progressive: [Students Have the Right to Protest Apartheid](https://progressive.org/op-eds/students-have-the-right-to-protest-apartheid-sanchez-20240502/). My lovely fiancÃ© wrote a piece about the student protests for Palestine.

> While the Republican-led Congress has used its power to condemn any protests on behalf of Palestinians, where was the same outrage and zealousness when white nationalists came to college campuses?
