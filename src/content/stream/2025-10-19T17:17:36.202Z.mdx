I've been thinking how much politics I've been paying attention to since the inauguration.
I think the expectation things would be different and the enthusiasm felt about how some tech folks thought we could built government better was at best a shortfall.
I didn't have those personal feelings as I felt much the opposite, on how to prepare for authoritarianism and tyranny.

That's why I think this podcast conversation between Jasmine Sun and Kelsey Piper was an eye opener to understand and keep tabs on the tech community sentiment on current US politics.

This pairs very nicely with understanding extremist views from Nadia Asparouhova's book release this year, _Antimemetics: Why Some Ideas Resist Spreading_.

I have a lot to say about this book, but I'll do a write-up later.
Back to the conversation, I think my previous post about how [the vibes are off](/curation/stream/link/2025-04-02t163931340z) is a much better metric of how Democrats lost the 2024 election in a huge way because they were not assessing what public sentiment was anymore.
We need more acknowledgement of real-world struggles, not the stats of GDP numbers.
