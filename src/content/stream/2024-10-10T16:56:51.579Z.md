title: "Advice - The tool should conform to your workflow"
---

The tool should confirm to your workflow, not the otherway around.
When you let the tool dictate your workflow, you disrupt your own flow.
Tools can teach us about new workflows, but it's up to our own judgment if that works for or against us.

Tools are not panaceas. They cannot solve all of our problems. The corollary advice about tools is when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

A good tool is one that can do one thing very good. A multi-tool is great if you know it can do each task very well. When it fails at one of those things, you know it's not a great tool, and you may need to make other tools interoperable with one another. Sometimes, your tools don't play well. Don't try to make them interoperable if they have no means to. These tools were never the solution to your problem in the first place.
