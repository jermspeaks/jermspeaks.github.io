d3 v7 is packaged as ESM only. That made it difficult to use in the Node.js REPL. From this [StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54784608/how-can-i-import-an-es-module-in-the-node-js-repl-in-node-8), I found a solution.

```js
let d3;
import("d3").then((module) => {
  d3 = module;
});
// Then you can use d3 anywhere once the promise is resolved.
```
