title: "jscodeshift Object Destructuring"

The shorthand option is must be used in object destructuring to remove redundant `prop: value` to be `prop`.

What I wanted was this shorthand:

```js
const { asFragment } = render(container);
```

But what codemod generated was the following:

```js
const { asFragment: asFragment } = render(container);
```

While both are true, I would rather have the shorthand, as that's what we have strictly for eslint rules. This [Github Issue](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift/issues/403) helped describe the solution on how to implement in your transform file.

```js
const code = j.objectProperty(j.identifier("h"), j.identifier("h"));
code.shorthand = true;

j.variableDeclaration("const", [
  j.variableDeclarator(
    j.objectPattern([code]),
    j.callExpression(j.identifier("require"), [j.identifier('"packagename"')])
  ),
]);
```
