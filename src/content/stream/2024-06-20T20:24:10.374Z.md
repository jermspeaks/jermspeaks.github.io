How to embed TikTok videos in Obsidian's editing/live preview and reading mode.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://www.tiktok.com/player/v1/7382225350710824222?autoplay=0"
  allow="fullscreen"
  style="width:100%;height:50vh;"
/>
```

where `7382225350710824222` is the video id you get from TikTok from this example link: `https://www.tiktok.com/@_jen_hamilton_/video/7382225350710824222`.

The TikTok v1 player has a bunch of controls that you can use to modify from this [documentation](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/embed-player#customize_the_player_).

There's still some wonky height issues, and I suspect this is the default height Obsidian has on the container around the editor. I gave it a good enough viewable height of `50vh`, which should be enough.

### Example Video

</div>
