title: "Setting up SVGR with Jest"
---

I was getting some errors in my unit test output because I converted my SVGs to React components using [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/).
As such, I needed to re-configure Jest accordingly.

1. Create the mock file

```js
export default "svgr-div"; // This is the kebab case that jest is looking for
export const ReactComponent = "div";

// @see https://react-svgr.com/docs/jest/ for setup
```

2. Configure jest in `package.json`

```json
{
  "jest": {
    "moduleNameMapper": {
      "\\.svg": "<rootDir>/PATH_TO_FOLDER/svg.js"
    }
  }
}
```
