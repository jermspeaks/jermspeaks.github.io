[Steve Yegge's Gas Town post](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04) is absolutely bonkers in terms of AI token spend.

It also reminds me, the simpler explanation of how things work is much better. 
Maggie Appleton's post is a lot easier to understand from someone who has a visual expertise in breaking down how something complicated could work using the correct metaphors.
It also helps that the images produced aren't AI generated from Google's Nano Banana.

Some notable takeaways:

- > Design and planning becomes the bottleneck when agents write all the code
