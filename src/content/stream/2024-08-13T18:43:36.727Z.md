Josh Cunningham wrote a piece called [Imagining a Personal Data Pipeline](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/personal-data-pipeline/?utm_source=tldrwebdev). I started exploring his project, [pdpl-cli](https://github.com/PersonalDataPipeline/pdpl-cli/tree/main), which helps you download your personal data and pipe it out to your desired output. I've been thinking extensively about this problem for a number of weeks now since I've exported my Google Contacts into Obsidian. However, with the lack of database support, I thought about self hosting it. Enter the Personal Data Pipeline.

![Overview of the data pipeline](https://www.joshcanhelp.com/_images/d2/personal-data-pipeline-elt.png)

It's essentially ETL jobs with integrations to third party services to "recipes" that you can write in yaml and customize to your desired outputs. I think this helps a lot more than determining data schemas for specific third party data integrations and having the raw data in a personal data lake. (Or really maybe a document store).

The idea is to have it local-first and maybe include a sync-thing or cloud syncing as an optional add-on. There's an emphasis on privacy, although my bigger fear is vendor lock-in. I've become so reliant on Google, Apple, and other services that I don't feel like I own my personal data anymore. Also, as a web developer, the hardest part is grabbing my own data from the sticky hands of these cloud services. Also, this emphasis on files over apps makes a lot more sense to me than the walled garden approach we've become accustomed to.
