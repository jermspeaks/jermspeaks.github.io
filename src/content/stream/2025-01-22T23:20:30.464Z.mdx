title: "Bye bye, Meta"
---

I've had it. The last time I logged into Instagram, there were a couple of right-wing organizations recommended to me. I don't care if it's [a glitch](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g32yxpdz0o), it's not acceptable. If a CEO tries to be someone you can't understand or respect, it's time to leave.

![A Farewell to most Meta products](../../images/meta-bye.png)

This is my decision to leave Facebook, Threads, and Instagram. It's been years on these apps, and it's time for a farewell.

### Caveat

I am still on Whatsapp due to communication with some friends who haven't left that platform yet. I fear Facebook has such a monopoly on there, and I realize such drastic measures are hard to keep when it comes to cutting off ties with everyone.
