Extremely esoteric bug. I've had an open issue for the past three months related to this other [issue](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/issues/2022). I couldn't figure out why npm's registry would pull an older version of `d3-scale-chromatic` when I upgraded the `@observable/plot` library. As a future note for myself, if I run into this issue again, I'll have to go into the `package-lock.json` file and update `d3-scale-chromatic` to `v3.1.0`.
