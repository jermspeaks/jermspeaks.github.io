title: "Intl Locale String with Timezone"

It's always fun when the MDN documentation doesn't tell us what the options are within the methods page, I you have to dig deeper into [the constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat). The TypeScript bindings don't always make sense.

[MDN - toLocaleString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString)

Anyways, I needed a datetime string with the date, time in hours and minutes, and the timezone. I've made the timezone explicit and came up with this snippet.

```js
date.toLocaleString("en-us", {
  year: "numeric",
  month: "short",
  day: "numeric",
  hour: "numeric",
  minute: "numeric",
  timeZone: "America/Los_Angeles",
  timeZoneName: "short",
});
```

This would return something like "2024-07-03, 12:00 PM, PDT".
