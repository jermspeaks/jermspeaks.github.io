"The vibes are off" is a colloquial expression used to describe a situation where something feels wrong or uncomfortable, even if it cannot be precisely explained. It suggests that the atmosphere or emotional tone of a place, interaction, or event is not as expected or desired. This phrase often implies a sense of unease or discomfort that is sensed intuitively rather than being based on specific, tangible evidence. The term **"vibes"** refers to a distinctive feeling or quality that can be sensed, often involving shared emotional states or atmospheres.

And then there's this.
