I forked a [small demo from Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/hot-tips/tree/main/import-maps) and ran in on my own [sandbox](https://github.com/jermspeaks/magic-sand/blob/main/import-maps/index.html). It seems much cleaner than using a script tag per each dependency, and works on all major browsers.

In my little demo app, I placed the importmap in the head of the document. I'm using react as well as my own utils file to test out the functionality.

```html
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "react-dom": "https://esm.sh/react-dom",
      "react": "https://esm.sh/react",
      "utils": "./utils.js"
    }
  }
</script>
```

Read more about importmap on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)

From there, I imported these libraries in a script module.

```html
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script type="module">
    /* eslint-disable */
    import { useState } from "react";
    import { createRoot } from "react-dom";
    import { formatMoney } from "utils";
    createRoot(document.querySelector(`#app`)).render(formatMoney(100.2365));
  </script>
</body>
```

I had a hiccup with \[plugin:vite:import-analysis\] as I found countless others have, so I wrote a custom bun server to host this project. Hopefully there's a better setup I can find with Vite using importmap in the future.
