title: "Introducing Discord Server"
---

I've started a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/p9WFChR9gK)!
This is a place for more group setting conversation. I have found Discord as a much easier way to interact with people, which I wish was more the case of other social media. The real-time nature of old-school IRC mixed with modern features allows us to make fun, creative conversation. Just abide by the code of conduct of being respectful. With anything, moderation is the key.

Enjoy!
