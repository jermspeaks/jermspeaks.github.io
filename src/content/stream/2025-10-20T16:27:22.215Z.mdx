title: "Website News - Callouts and Link Previews"
---

Quick website news. I've added callouts for some areas of the website, including the newsletter at the bottom.
I removed a bunch of social links that no longer are representative of where I'm at online.
I've removed the two-layout style for a single one since the content I'm usually here to bring is not worth the width.

I've created link previews! For select (and recent) links, I'm now using a `LinkPreview` Astro component.
It's using the metadata from websites to create these nice link previews.
There's a manual override in case the parsing did not reach my standards of link previews.

As an example, the new **Track Star Podcast** is awesome, and here's the latest episode I watched.

import LinkPreview from "../../components/LinkPreview.astro";

<LinkPreview

There's many other small updates to make the website feel more user friendly, including updated pagination and updating tags.
Also, the line breaks in essay content is longer now, so you can figure out if you want to choose to read more.
