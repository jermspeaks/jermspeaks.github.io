### Observations

Key Principles for Building a Creative Organization

- **Bias towards action** - Make decisions quickly, do things fast, and solve problems without overthinking.
- Treat others with **kindness and respect**, both within and outside the team.
- Templates - Find where structure works and leaves room for creativity.
  - They specifically mentioned templates in the context of creating a reliable system that supports creativity. Templates refer to establishing repeatable formats that streamline the creative process and improve team collaboration.
  - Johnny Harris mentioned that **script templates** were a very large document with tables, color coding, and other elements that enable a team to work together with communication and structure. Izzy Harris added that these are **structures that still allow for creativity**. The aim is to systemize repetitive creative tasks without constraining creative output, enabling consistent execution and scalability.
    - In my own way, templates have allowed me to stay focused, also had to grow organically because I need to understand the underlying structure first
- **Care more about getting it right than being right**. That lends itself to feedback and being open to it.

The odd thing about Voice Notes

- Johnny and Izzy Harris use voice notes as a method of communication to increase efficiency and maintain a personal touch. Johnny uses voice notes, looms, and Marco Polos to communicate with his team, as he can convey what needs to be said in minutes. Izzy noted she is delighted by 6 second voice notes.
- Voice notes are useful for asynchronous communication. Team members do not need to be available at the same time in order to communicate effectively
- Voice notes allow for more detailed explanations and can convey nuance and tone more effectively than text-based communication

NewPress

New Press is envisioned as a **new news media entity** that will function as an umbrella company overseeing five to eight Creator-led, independent journalism channels.

  - **Creator-Led Channels**: New Press will consist of multiple channels, each led by independent creators.
