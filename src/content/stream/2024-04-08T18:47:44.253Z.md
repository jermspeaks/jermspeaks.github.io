I periodically try to dump all of my mental contexts into my notes. I noticed this comes in a few different flavors.

- Safari Tabs on my iPhone and iPad: Goes into daily notes
- Random thoughts - go into drafts and get processed daily
- Shopping - including groceries, bills, and things I would like but not need. Those all go into a task manager
- Dangling tasks - gets reviewed in the task manager inbox weekly
- Personal thoughts - journaling every two weeks, although I want to do this more often
- Events I have not logged - go into my calendar.
- Downloads folder - weekly processed into other folders.
  - Long-term storage in Dropbox and backup drive.
  - Short-term in Inbox folder
- Photos - place special ones in folders. Select shots in favorites.

I am trying to think of other things that I purge. I used to write in a notepad and write on the page of everything I was thinking about. I used to write about people I have not spoken to in a long time that I should reach out to, mantras I came up with, or completely random thoughts.
