[Typst](https://typst.app/) is "a new markup-based typesetting system that is powerful and easy to learn."

It seems very interesting as an alternative to LaTeX. A lot of emphasis on typesetting. I haven't gotten the chance to work with LaTeX, so I'd be curious if jumping over that and learning this might be a good alternative. Plus, it has a multiplayer feature built.

Check out their [Github](https://github.com/typst/typst), written in Rust.
