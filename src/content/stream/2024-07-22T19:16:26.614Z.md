title: "AI Summer or Winter?"
---

The post from Latent Space reporting for this quarter's AI review, [The Winds of AI Winter](https://www.latent.space/p/mar-jun-2024), tries to analyze the macro trends for AI. Long story short: there are high doubts about AI's current capabilities and its distribution is uneven. "Time to build, or else AI Winter is coming".

- ChatGPT's growth has been level (0%) over this past quarter. Related: [The Unbundling of ChatGPT (Feb 2024 Recap)](https://www.latent.space/p/feb-2024)
- I forgot that Google is in a downward spiral for "Google AI Overviews being [bad](https://x.com/nathanlands/status/1793925460801581300?s=46&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww), [bad](https://x.com/very__regular/status/1794010853257126316?s=46&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww), [bad](https://x.com/jeremiahdjohns/status/1794543007129387208?s=46&t=6FDPaNxZcbSsELal6Sv7Ug), [bad](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40431495) (after [the Gemini mess](https://x.com/debarghya_das/status/1760510978662519122?s=46&t=tMWvmS3OL3Ssg0b9lKvp4Q))". I'm really interested in how Google is trying to bounce back. Yesterday at the theaters, they were trying very hard to advertise the new AI features on the latest Pixel.
- A bunch of AI product recalls like Rabbit, Microsoft "Recall", Figma AI, McDonalds drive-thru AI, Discord cancelling Clyde
- Non-Acquihiring means there isn't an acquisition to hire the talent from one organization to another, but taking away talent to another company without acquiring the company. [Adept](https://www.adept.ai/) [lost their co-founders to Amazon](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/28/amazon-hires-founders-away-from-ai-startup-adept/). And Inflection Pi [to Microsoft](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/1770123596121432351)
- And of course, over-hyping technology and having high churn, like [Harvey](https://www.harvey.ai/) in private

The biggest takeaway is big spend and slow return. The the [Goldman Sachs report](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/gen-ai-too-much-spend-too-little-benefit/report.pdf) and [Sequoia's report](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/?itm_medium=related-content&itm_source=sequoiacap.com) break it down. The one that telle me the most was the distribution of stock returns per phase of AI, where Phase 1 is the chips where Nvidia are doing the best. Phase 2 is the infrastructure running behind it, which is increasing. But Phase 3 and 4, of enabled revenues and productivity are flatlined.

We're hoping the future will hold better for AI in general, but I'll leave this quote from Asimov.
