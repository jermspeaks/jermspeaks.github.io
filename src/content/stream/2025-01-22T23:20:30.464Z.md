title: "Bye bye, Meta"
---

I've had it. The last time I logged into Instagram, there were a couple of right-wing organizations recommended to me. I don't care if it's [a glitch](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g32yxpdz0o), it's not acceptable. If a CEO tries to be someone you can't understand or respect, it's time to leave.

This is my decision to leave Facebook, Threads, and Instagram. It's been years on these apps, and it's time for a farewell.

### Caveat

I am still on Whatsapp due to communication with some friends who haven't left that platform yet. I fear Facebook has such a monopoly on there, and I realize such drastic measures are hard to keep when it comes to cutting off ties with everyone.
