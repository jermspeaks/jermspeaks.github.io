title: "The \"Boring\" Stack"
---

I was listening to this podcast: [The boring JavaScript stack featuring Kelvin Omereshone (K.O.O) (JS Party #319)](https://changelog.com/jsparty/319). My takeaway is I should be using a boring stack to build my business ideas. Leave the [shiny new toys](https://nesslabs.com/shiny-toy-syndrome) for tinkering and use something stable.

While Kelvin talks about the benefits of using [Sails](https://docs.sailscasts.com/boring-stack/getting-started), I was thinking about the other "boring" things that constitute a boring stack. It goes [beyond tecnologies](https://leaddev.com/technical-direction-strategy/boring-stack), like how to run a business, how to organize your team, and how to market the product. And when those things are boring, they are unsexy and oftentimes neglected.
