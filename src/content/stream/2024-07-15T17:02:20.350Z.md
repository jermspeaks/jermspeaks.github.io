title: "Broadcom and Henry T. Nicholas III"

A curiosity sparked because my co-worker pointed out the Spring Framework is currently owned by Broadcom. That's because [VMware is now part of Broadcom](https://www.broadcom.com/info/vmware), and Spring Framework was part of VMWare prior. I had an inkling there was a scandal Broadcom had awhile ago. Low and behold: [SEC Charges Four Current and Former Broadcom Officers for Backdating Options (Press Release No. 2008-87, May 14, 2008)](https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-87.htm). In 2010, the charges were dropped - [Chipmaker Broadcom stock options backdating case ends](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/chipmaker-broadcom-stock-options-backdating-case-ends-idUSTRE64S0A6/). That's not all though. Their first CEO, [Henry Nicholas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Nicholas) had criminal charges. The SEC dropped those charges in 2010, but that was enough to disgrace the people involved. Their former SEO left Broadcom before the SEC investigation back in 2003 to "work on his marriage". He was sleeping with prostitutes.

Read: [Henry T. Nicholas III: A human tragedy](https://www.cnet.com/culture/henry-t-nicholas-iii-a-human-tragedy/). And the follow-up a decade later with [Orange County tech billionaire Henry T. Nicholas III charged with drug trafficking following Las Vegas arrest](https://www.ocregister.com/2019/02/13/orange-county-tech-billionaire-henry-t-nicholas-iii-charged-with-drug-trafficking-following-las-vegas-arrest/).

> The court filings in the past case painted Nicholas as a ruthless entrepreneur who slipped drugs to competitors without their knowledge, who threatened the lives of employees he believed had turned against him, who had the means and motive to flee beyond the reach of justice in his private jet.

His start was in researching ICs, and later that's what Broadcom sold. He was given awards for his research. He's like a walking contradiction, trying to save his name with his philanthropy while making wildly bad decisions. File under downfalls.
