Back in the day, I used to get the SF Chronicle newspaper delivered. They had this iconic "Little Man" where I remember seeing them in movie reviews. I was never the biggest fan of the star rating system. The thumbs up system that Siskel and Ebert had was a little better as two critics giving their opinions. The little man had visuals that explain how I would recommend a movie to someone. As not even worth your time, something to sit through, and standing ovation (or in the little man's case, jumping out of your seat clapping).
