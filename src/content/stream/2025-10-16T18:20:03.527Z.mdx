title: "Little Man"

Back in the day, I used to get the SF Chronicle newspaper delivered. They had this iconic "Little Man" where I remember seeing them in movie reviews. I was never the biggest fan of the star rating system. The thumbs up system that Siskel and Ebert had was a little better as two critics giving their opinions. The little man had visuals that explain how I would recommend a movie to someone. As not even worth your time, something to sit through, and standing ovation (or in the little man's case, jumping out of your seat clapping).

  description="Since the early 1940s, the small bald guy in the bowler hat has been the Bay Area's arbiter of good taste. Used by Chronicle critics as a rating icon, he really gets around â€” to movies, live theater, concerts and football games. Here's an illustrated guide to some of the places The Chronicle dispatched him this year."
