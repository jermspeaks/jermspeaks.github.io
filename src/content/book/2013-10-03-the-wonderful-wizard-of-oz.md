I'm surprised this book is over 100 years old. I'll be honest. I had no reason to read this children's novel except that Audible has it for quite a cheap, low price. And it was narrated by Anne Hathaway, actress of "The Princess Diaries," "The Devil Wears Prada," and "Brokeback Mountain." It's interesting to notice the little differences from the film, even though I don't think I ever saw the film all the way to the end. Also, I don't think I actually read the book before, but know the story pretty much by heart. It's still a delightful read and it's incredibly short, but long for a child. This actually brings up whether I should actually read Wicked about the Wicked witch of the west that is killed pretty early in this book. This also may be the first mention of munchkins. I may read "The Hobbit" next because Audible has daily deals. Or else I'll just finished the fucking bible first. When I do finish the bible, I'll definitely give you the low down and we can snap at all of those fundamentalists.
