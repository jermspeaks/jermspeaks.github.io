Apparently I have read more books in the last year and a half than in… well since I was in Grade School. I’m going to start doing a weekly book review, starting this week.

This week, it is “Crush It: Why NOW is the Time to Cash In on your Passion” by Gary Vaynerchuck. It is part business, part memoirs about Gary’s path through creating Vaynermedia. There’s a lot of good business concepts that he talks about, including to really go after your passion. However, the book falls short by being a longer version of his keynotes as the book is dictated rather than written. Also, there’s not enough case studies that I would’ve liked. I have yet to read “The Thank You Economy”, which is also by him, but I’ve been told that it is a better because he’s spent more time improving from his last book.
