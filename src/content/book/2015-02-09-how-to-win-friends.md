You'll often find Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People" on many people's list of top self-help books. Published in the '30s, Carnegie tells some simple ways to talk and interact with people. It tells you to be kind and listen to others. To me, it was a bunch of common sense, but at the same time, it's worth a quick flip through. If you actually read the book, you'll hear about Carnegie's fascination with Lincoln and a ton of parables to back what he's saying.
