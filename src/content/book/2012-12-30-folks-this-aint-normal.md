Farming should be a better renounced profession than it is thought to be today. It’s strange how we live in such an upside-down world where we don’t have the slightest clue where our food comes from. While the solutions Salatin proposes in this book may not sound completely feasible, the book makes very sound arguments that we really should consider about food.
