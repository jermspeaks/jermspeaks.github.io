[Stephen Covey's "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"](https://www.amazon.com/7-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/0935721800/) is a rudimentary for common sense. It's read widely by Cal Poly's Business 101 course, and I pulled a few things out of that, like the basics of negotiation. Honestly, I don't remember the fine points of this book, like the actual 7 points, after reading Covey was a Mormon. After I shook off the religious bit, I couldn't concentrate on what he was saying anymore, which sounds really shallow of me. I had the opposite reaction to Anne Lamott's book, ["Bird By Bird"](/curation/books/2015-02-09-bird-by-bird) after reading she was a Christian.
