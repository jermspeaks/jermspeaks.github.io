I choose [The Happiness Hypothesis](/library/books/2012-12-30-the-happiness-hypothesis) over this book because this book only focuses on the stoic teachings, and not the entire spectrum of philosophy. However, that said, there's plenty to learn about controlling emotion and minimalism from the stoics. If meditation doesn't work and you must reason your way through stress, this book shows you exercises on how to cope.
