A biography of the life of Benjamin Franklin thatâ€™s worth reading if you enjoyed the Steve Jobs Biography from Issacson. This really reveals the life that Franklin had as one of the first American entrepreneurs. Franklin was no god though; he had his faults. But the thing that sets himself apart from others is his willingness that he can change, for example his stance on the abolitionists or breaking away from the British.
