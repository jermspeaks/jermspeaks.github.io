This week’s review is short. It’s for “[I Am A Pole (And So Can You)](https://www.amazon.com/Am-Pole-And-Can-You/dp/1455523429)” by Stephen Colbert. It’s a lovely children’s book that plays with his previous book, “I Am An American (And So Can You),” but with the physical object of a pole. I listened to it on Audible with Tom Hanks narrating this, and it’s quite hilarious, and age appropriate.
