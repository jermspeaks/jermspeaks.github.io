A fairly short book about building relationships in the long run. This was recommended by my roommate and many people on the Internet. Most relationships break down because of communication, specifically each partner does not know how to speak or listen to each other's love languages. When you learn about each one, you can start to notice your past relationships and see where things started to break down. Dr. Chapman has been in his field for over two decades counseling marriages when he wrote this book, and it's a culmination of distilling into 5 simple points of how couples speak to each other. Ignore the fact he's religious because there's practical value here, and he tries to be fairly secular.
