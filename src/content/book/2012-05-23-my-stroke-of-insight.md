The book I’ve read last week was Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor’s “My Stroke of Insight”. Here is the [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight) she gave about her experience, and the book expands upon that. It’s split up on the story of her stroke, recovery, and next steps. It debunks common myths around strokes, and it gave me a better understanding about my own mind.

### Updates 2015-02-09

This book was a lot shorter than I imagined. It's about a scientist who studies strokes and finds herself having one early in life (in her mid-30's). She talks about the journey into her mind as she's having the stroke and the path to recovery. I watched her TED Talk before reading her book, and I must say I am amazed at how much I didn't know about strokes, especially at the rates that it's afflicted people. I could relate to stroke victims because that's what killed my grandfather a few years ago.
