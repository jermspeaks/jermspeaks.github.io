A group from the Harvard Business School came out over a decade ago with their seminal work about office relationships and communication called "Difficult Conversations" in which the team tried to understand what it is that makes us avoid having tough conversations with co-workers, family and friends. They turned that study into a book called "Difficult Conversations" on how to initiate these conversations. This book, "Thanks for the Feedback" explores the next step, which is someone has posed a difficult conversation to you, and explains how you should respond. You don't have to read "Difficult Conversations" to understand this book at all, and it's practical from the very beginning. I really wish I had read this when I did my senior project and had to manage a group of 5 people.
