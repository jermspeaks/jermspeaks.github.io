As I mentioned, this was my second choice. I think this book is great in its research on habits and the author's journey changing one of his habits that resulted in weight loss. But don't take his weight loss story as motivation to read this book. It's more about the power good habits can bring to your life and how bad habits are hard to unlearn. However, by the end of the book, Duhigg breaks down habit formation in easy steps and you can follow it too. There's also this great infographic about the steps online.
