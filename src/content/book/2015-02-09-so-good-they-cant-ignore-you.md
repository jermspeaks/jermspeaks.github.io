I've followed [Mr. Newport's blog](https://calnewport.com/blog/) for quite some time and read his other book, "[How to Be a High School Superstar](https://amzn.to/3MA7szc)", because I wanted to know if it was good to give my sister a few years back when she asked me what she should do in High School. To me, this is thecareer book. It begins by telling you that the pursuit to do something your passionate about is a myth. In fact, Mr. Newport claims that it's the job and career that guides you to your passion. You have to build your own career up, and it's going to have lots of twists and turns before you truly know what you're going to do. I've gifted this to my cousin and she has taken this advice and went back to graduate school because she wants to build up the skill to do more in graphic communication. I didn't consider this book to give to you because I thought about self-help before career advice, so maybe you should ask me nicely for your birthday next year (but in all seriousness, purchase this book if you can. It really is worth it).
