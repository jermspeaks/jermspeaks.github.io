title: "Foodist: Using Real Food and Real Science to Lose Weight Without Dieting"
---

I don't need to diet. But I do enjoy reading about a good, healthy living style. Some deviations from other diet books is that this book doesn't actually talk about which diet to take. Instead, it uses science to back itself up that we should all have a good food foundation because diets tend to be shortcoming success, but relapse rates are quite high. Instead, this book raves about eating healthy from the beginning of your food adventure through more vegetables and try to gain the habit of cooking for yourself or making better food choices. You've probably seen me reading this book before, but now I've actually finished the darn thing. I didn't learn too much except the author calls this new diet, which isn't a diet, healthstyle. I think I like this neologism.
