This book is the entry book to practicing meditation without all of the spiritual fluff that's usually included with most zen meditation practices. Perhaps anything else, this book taught me the importance of awareness and that meditation should be an extension of that awareness, not an escape from reality. Also recommended is "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind" by Shunryu Suzuki, which introduces the concept of proper meditation. Here is a great talk (or rather meditation session) [he did @Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijnt-eXukwk).
