Welcome to the second series of the Jear-Bear letters. For the new readers, this is my weekly newsletter. I used to write short essays of things that interested me with an intention I could read this a year later and remain interested.

During months of February and March, I will be writing letters on the theme of **"repeated failure"**. Expect releases on Monday, unless I get too busy and release a Tuesday letter.

If you like what you're reading, share this newsletter. You could go as far as sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, or going retro, snail mail! If you're feeling adventurous, ~~subscribe them by entering their email on [my Tinyletter page](https://tinyletter.com/jeremywong/).~~

### Update: 2024-02-01

[Tinyletter is out of operation](https://mailchi.mp/85e4c601669a/tinylettersunsetcurrent-221169). I've created a new newsletter using button.down, which you can subscribe to on the [newsletter page](/curation/newsletter#subscribe).
