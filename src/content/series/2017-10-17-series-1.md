title: "Newsletter: Season One"
description: "Original Run of Jear-Bear Letters. As the newsletter premise explains, I explore aspects of my life and reflect on them. I take the time to explore myself and come to a deeper understanding of who I am and where I want to be. Sometimes I get serious and write about topics below the water line. Other times, I find a narrative around recent events of my life."

Welcome to the first Jear Bear Letter. My aim is to write something meaningful every week which may vary in length. I love story-telling and love to share. I really hope you enjoy it and feedback is much appreciated.

If you enjoy this letter, please share it around. Tell people to subscribe to my weekly letters [here](http://tinyletter.com/jeremywong). I promise to post sparingly, like once a week.
