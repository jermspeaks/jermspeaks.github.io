As a former medical device engineer turned software engineer, I leverage a unique cross-functional perspective for innovative problem-solving and briding the gap amongst stakeholders. Specializing in full-stack JavaScript and TypeScript, my expertise includes front-end development, data visualizations, responsive web design, and UX. My skills enables me to create products that are not only technically robust but also intuitive, accessible, inclusive, and delightful for users.

My active stack includes React, Svelte, Next.js, Astro, Figma, Node, Postgres, Vercel, Netlify, and Github Actions, Jest, and  Cypress.
