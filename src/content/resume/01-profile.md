I am a former medical device engineer turned software engineer, with an emphasis in front-end development, data visualizations, and UX. I write a lot of Javascript and Typescript, and sometimes Go when I need a backend server. I am passionate about creating products that are intuitive, accessible, inclusive, and delightful to use.

I am currently residing in the Bay Area, California, USA. I'm open to local or remote work.
