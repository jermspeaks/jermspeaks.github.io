As a former medical device engineer turned software engineer, I leverage a unique cross-functional perspective for innovative problem-solving and bridge the gap in collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders. Specializing in full-stack JavaScript and TypeScript, my expertise includes front-end development, data visualizations, responsive web design, and UX. This blend of technical prowess and effective communication enables me to create products that are not only technically robust but also intuitive, accessible, inclusive, and delightful for users.

I am currently residing in the Bay Area, California, USA. I'm open to local or remote work.
