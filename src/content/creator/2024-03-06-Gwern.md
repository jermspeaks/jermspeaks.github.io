If there's a website I most want to aspire to be it's Gwern. I remember stumbling
on this over a decade ago, and coming back on and off. The website is like a 
personal wikipedia, and far before I heard the concept of Personal Knowledge
Management. There's a little bit of everything, from the quantified self, AI,
darknet markets, Bitcoin, and so much more.

I don't think most content I read daily has longevity past the first few days.
I would like to write more evergreen work, and something that can withstand the
test of time.

Also, there's so much information about how I could better serve this website
in the future, like a [dedicated Hetzner server](https://gwern.net/about#popularity).
