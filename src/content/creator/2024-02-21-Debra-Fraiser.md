I spoke to Debra a few years ago at an online course event. We talked about her
home in Ashville, North Carolina, about the swatches she had for her children's
books, and about travel from Patagonia, Paris, Bologna, and Munich.

It didn't hit me until today she's also the author of [On the Day You Were Born](https://www.debrafrasier.com/books-things-to-do/on-the-day-you-were-born/),
a book read to me as a child at my Elementary school's library.

> A [lyrical poem] that welcomes each child to the every day miracles of planet Earth – the Sun, Moon, North Star, wind, rain, tides and the circle of people awaiting each child.

I highly recommend Debra's children's books and art. She released a new book last
year entitled [This Is the Planet Where I Live](https://www.debrafrasier.com/books-things-to-do/this-is-the-planet-where-i-live/). She also runs "[Paper Camp](https://www.debrafrasier.com/paper-camp/)" where "we can joyfully experiment with cutting paper together".
