Sometimes I have projects in mind that make no sense what-so-ever. I listened to
the [Sporkful podcast](https://www.sporkful.com/) host Dan Pashman journey to
making his own pasta shape. Something in my mind clicked -- I want to make a
website collecting pasta shapes.

Cut to a few years later, I bought this book. Instead of making the project, I'll
read this book and see if it's still something I want to do. We will see.
