The following are some notes that are influenced by his work about EI. I might spin this off into its own blog post if anyone is interested.

- What is emotional intelligence (EI)?
  - self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy and social skills
- Why is EI important?
  - IQ < EQ for great engineers at Google
  - EQ vs. IQ as Predictor: Study in the UK for babies for success
  - Happier people

- EQ is trainable (see study in Oakland elementary schools, fixed vs. growth mindset)
- Neuroplasticity - What we pay attention to changes our brain
  - e.g. London Cabbies, Hippocampus
  - More we learn to pay attention to us, to others empathetically, we can train ourself

- Approach EQ: Competencies and skills vs. behavior
  - NOT behavior (how to play nice to each other)
  - More about developing competencies - ability to regulate emotions (raising awareness)

### Competencies: Awareness, Empathy, and Intuition

- **Awareness**: Paying attention to the emotional and physical body

> Emotion is a basic physiological state characterized by identifiable autonomic or bodily changes.
> — Dr. Laura Delizonna

- **Awareness**: Develop a high resolution awareness of emotions as they arise. Own our emotions instead of them owning us.
- **Empathy**: Develop a high resolution awareness of emotion _in others_ as they arise
- **Empathy**: Leadership as inspiration, empowerment, and compassion
  - Navy officers, best ones are empathetic
  - Exchanging leadership, leadership is interactive, not a role or position
  - Know the difference between an Ask and a Need, e.g. jackets in an office, paired programming stuck

- **Intuition**:
  - Idaho study card game - conscious awareness ~80 turns, hunch 45 turns, intuition 10 turns (see Blink by Malcolm Gladwell, snap judgements)

## Feedback

- Why Feedback?
  - Learning = soliciting, receiving, and integrating feedback
  - Toddlers learn by immediate feedback, get a sense of their surroundings
  - (see Validated Learning in “The Lean Startup”)
- Feedback Loops
  - Polar Bear & Gas Station
  - Minute and Time & burgers
  - Most feedback loops are too slow (cancer, diabetes, health issues)
- Feedback Ninjas
  - People LOVE getting feedback from me
  - People LOVE giving me feedback
  - I LOVE getting feedback from people

### Feedback: Four Distinct Skills

- Soliciting Feedback
- Receiving Feedback
- Giving Feedback
- Integrating Feedback

- **Soliciting Feedback** - NVC: Request vs. Demand 
  - (e.g. relationships), when saying no elicits a response, that’s a demand
- **Receiving Feedback**
  - The Compass of Shame (withdrawal, attack self, avoidance, attach other)
    - Withdrawal - isolate yourself, run away
    - Avoidance - substitute something else for feeling shame (escape, esp. subbing work)
    - Attack Self - take the shame, blow it out of proportion
    - Attack Other - blames others, most socially unacceptable one
      - (See Brene Brown, Power of Vulnerability)
      - Home Strategy: don’t compound the impulse. Notice it. And choose to not give into it. (See Power of Now, Mindfullness)
- **Giving Feedback**: Actionable, Specific, Kind (ASK)
  - Actionable - Something that I can do something about (something I have control over)
  - Specific - “Good job” vs “Slowed down and I could understand more clearly” (useful feedback)
  - Kind - kind is not nice, truth is kind, terrible dancer vs. stepping on toes, direct impact (objective) vs. what it means about you (subjective) 

- **Don’ts of Giving Feedback**
  - Don’t give advice, unless asked (See Mindfulness, I have/had this issue.)
    - Different than pointing out a problem
    - Disrupts feedback loop
  - Don’t do shit sandwich
    - Shit Sandwich: Two nice things around one shit thing
      - Dilutes meaning of feedback
  - Don’t rate or compare
    - Compare one human to another, tempting, but avoid this

- **Barriers to giving feedback**
  - Fear of conflict - 80% is better than nothing
    - Not speaking that extra 20% can lead to miscommunication down the road, and you can do that forever in your life and take the avoidance or withdrawal strategy (not advisable)
    - Mistrusting our seeing (See: WYSIWYG, Snap Judgment)
    - Our seeing doesn’t matter (See: WYSIWYG, Fonzie’s idea of talking to other people)
  - Your voice matters
- **Integrating Feedback** 
  - Make it useful for you
  - Impact of you and teaches you what to change (but not hearsay, not 100% truth, but don’t pass it off)
