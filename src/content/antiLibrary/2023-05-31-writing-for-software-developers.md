title: "Writing for Software Developers"
blurb: "\"Writing for Software Developers focuses on teaching you how to envision, create, and publish mid-length technical tutorials and articles, but the principles and practices youâ€™ll develop will help you write anything from a short README to an entire technical book. And regardless of why you write, this guide aims to provide you with the techniques you will need to reach your goals.\""

Recommended by Shawn Swyx Wang. I'm especially interested in content writing that can help me improve my writing skills.
I know I have the capability to write articles for different publications. I would like a framework to be more systematic about it.
