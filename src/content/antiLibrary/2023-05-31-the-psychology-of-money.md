I've heard this book being recommended by multiple people, so maybe it's worth taking a glance at it. People include Ali Abdaal. It has other advise on how to think about money. I've read in the past Money: Master the Game by Tony Robbins, and a lot of the book felt like a promotional talk. So going away from that, I'm hoping this advice is more down to earth and straight to the point.
