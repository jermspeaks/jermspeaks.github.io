A broadside made on a vandercook proof press.
In other words, a broadside letterpress.
The quote is from [Jen Myers'](http://jenmyers.net/) newsletter, [Modern Adventures](http://tinyletter.com/jenmyers).
She wrote a list of life lessons she wants to teach her daughter.
This print combines two of her life lessons regarding empathy.
The text has been rearranged to follow a poetic rhythm.

For those unfamiliar with broadsides, they were large one-sided prints.
Some uses for these prints include proclamations, posters, or advertisements.
They were temporary documents meant to be thrown away.
Today, they are produced by boutique printers with an intention the broadside can be hung on the wall.

This broadside is printed on a thick paper stock at a size of 13" by 16".
Frame not included.

Note: There's a spelling mistake on this piece. "Anyways" should be "Anyway".
My inner grammarian is angry.
