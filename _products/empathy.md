A broadside made on a vandercook proof press. 
In other words, a broadside letterpress.
The quote is from [Jen Myers'](http://jenmyers.net/) newsletter, [Modern Adventures](http://tinyletter.com/jenmyers). 
She wrote a list of life lessons she wants to teach her daughter.
This print combines two of her life lessons regarding empathy.

For those unfamiliar with broadsides, they were prints on one side on large sized paper.
They could be proclamations, posters, or advertisements.
They were temporary documents meant to be thrown away.
Today, they are produced by boutique printers with an intention the broadside can be hung on the wall. 

This broadside is printed on a thick weight paper. 
Its size is 13" x 16". Frame not included.

Note: There's a spelling mistake on this piece. "Anyways" should be "Anyway".
My inner grammarian is angry.
