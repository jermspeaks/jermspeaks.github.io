<p>At the dawn of the world, I take out my shovel<br />
And dig and dig and dig,<br />
Like the early pioneers would do<br />
finding resources that the earth lain<br />
And I continued throughout the entire day<br />
finding my own resources in order to live through the night.<br />
Oh how awful the night has become<br />
With the crawlers and creepers infested over the twilight land</p>

<p>But alas, day is not their time<br />
and I must collect as much as I can<br />
Except for shoal<br />
Unbearable, unspeakable shoal<br />
Oh, why has the creators invent such a useless resource<br />
Neither coal nor sand<br />
It can not be crafted for other purposes<br />
Your so close to being obsidian<br />
I can’t even bear to carry one around</p>

<p>But that’s where I was wrong</p>

<p>I had not noticed said shoal<br />
upon my inventory or belt<br />
And there appeared only my sword, my axe, and tree bark<br />
But twas the nightfall<br />
Shoal was present, and I did the most respectable thing<br />
I threw it out hastily<br />
And it wobbled up and down<br />
spinning around<br />
Dancing upon the pixelated ground floor<br />
Why have you forsaken me, ole shoal</p>

<p>“Out and away with you, I’ll tear you apart!”<br />
My anger said<br />
And I took the shoal with me to the depths of the mines<br />
Where lava was to be found<br />
And that’s not all I intended<br />
I’ll find all of the shoal in the world<br />
And burn them too!<br />
That way I’ll never have to see one again<br />
But it wasn’t easy;<br />
the shoal had disappeared</p>

<p>The anger has flustered me to no ends that I made a huge mistake<br />
I was in the wrong home<br />
Well not even a home but an open cave<br />
Open for the dark lurkers intending to do me harm<br />
And I rushed out into the dark despair<br />
Running as fast as I could to Hideout D<br />
So I took off, trying to avoid as many enemies<br />
But in no time, I was surrounded<br />
And I had a dull blade and no back-up supplies<br />
So I did the most logical thing<br />
And I dug as fast as I could</p>

<p>The shovel took me as far down as another cave<br />
And I once escaped my enemies<br />
But now I was in another enemy territory<br />
With only one light to illuminate my space<br />
And I heard groaning in the seemingly still space<br />
“A creeper,” I thought<br />
The noise grew louder and louder<br />
And I just stood there. Afraid.</p>

<p>As the acrid sound touched my ear drum<br />
I felt fear, and other tingling sensations<br />
How was I so powerless<br />
Not being able to defend myself<br />
It was unbearable; but I didn’t want to surrender<br />
I saw the creeper and I leapt away as it noticed me<br />
It charged toward me and then<br />
And then, and then, the end?</p>

<p>Shoal came from the hole I dug earlier<br />
And landed on the creeper<br />
Exploding on impact.<br />
Shoal split into a thousand pieces<br />
And it disappeared<br />
Before my very own eyes<br />
Thank you shoal<br />
For saving my many lives<br />
I take back everything I said in the past about you<br />
I take back all the times I left you hovering in those caves<br />
Shoal, I liked our time together<br />
And you have a purpose</p>

<p>Morning came, and I escaped the cave<br />
Going back to HQ for resources<br />
Carrying with me a bag of shoal<br />
For safe keeping.</p>
