<p>I’m finally on a new platform and have full control of my content on
Squarespace. Shortly, I’m going to register a new domain for this website and
have this be my new home. Those who have migrated from my Tumblr need not worry
because I will still update that with photos and random short-form items that I
see not fit for this blog. The reason for the switch is that I want to be able
to express thoughts, show weird experiments I’m doing, and keep a journal-like
blog where I can add pictures, links, videos with ease and not worry that I can
only add one of those per post via Tumblr. Also, I’m not concise enough to be
tweeting every post either. And I’ve tried Wordpress before and ran a
semi-popular podcasting reviewing website in the past, and though I did like
their system, I feel Squarespace is more robust and can actually do a lot more.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, look out for updates. I’m going to start tweeting more
about this too to promote my website and my work. I’m also taking up photography
again to really showcase myself. So comment and tell me if I leave out anything,
like a “like” button on Facebook (which I’m not adding yet, but not completely
morally against), or a “pin it” button.</p>

<p>I leave you this quote on the shape of things to come.</p>
