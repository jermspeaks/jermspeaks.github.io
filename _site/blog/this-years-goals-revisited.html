        <h1 id="this-years-goals-revisited">This Year’s Goals Revisited</h1>

<p>As you may know, every year I’ve been releasing a yearly goal list. Last year, I went too far and tried to reach a whooping goal of 22 goals. Some of them were a mistake. Some of them were just a reminder of what I should keep in mind. I’m going to go over each one and tell you which ones failed and which ones actually succeeded.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Retain some other English accent<br />
Yup, failed this one. But I have a good reference point if I actually want to do this one. I was watching <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/signup.php">Rocketboom</a>, and they <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/signup.php">interviewed</a> <a href="http://www.stollersystem.com/">Amy Stoller</a>, which motivates me to get a coach or deconstruct dialects by myself.</li>
  <li>Take an Art or Photography class<br />
Strange this one goes on my list with no explanation. I’ve taken an art class before, so this shouldn’t really be a goal. I think the take-away goal here is that I should learn more of art or photography techniques. Failed this one, if we talk only about this year.</li>
  <li>Participate in a Marathon and train for it<br />
To be quite honest, I don’t think running is for me. However, I’ve been running a few times a week, though it’s the holidays, and it’s too cold outside. The treadmill is kind of my worst enemy. Maybe next year. Failed.</li>
  <li>52-Week Book Project.<br />
One book a week. I only recently rediscovered a passion for reading this summer, and I’ve been going at two books a month or so. This one is surely to catch up with me next year. Failed.</li>
  <li>Finish a collection of short stories<br />
It’s changed to being a novel now, which I’m currently working on. Failed.</li>
  <li>Make a 365 Photo-Blog.<br />
I’ve started with Day 1 on this blog already. I should have the blog up by next Monday. The goal is to post a picture a day.
Okay, this one needs no explanation. Failed.</li>
  <li>Watch and take notes on every Ted Talks<br />
Too many. I have a copy of each one, I just have to stop being lazy. Failed.</li>
  <li>Watch 1 Movie a Week<br />
I’ve never seen before that’s been recommended to me. <br />
I’ll start this on the first complete week of 2010.
I would’ve never guessed this one I succeeded in. As of this writing, I’ve watched one more than I actually needed to, though I think it’s a misrepresentation because I forgot to record two whole months of movies, so I tried my best to recall which movies I watched in March and April.</li>
  <li>Finish an Art piece and sell it.<br />
Nope, failed.</li>
  <li>Write a song, possibly a whole EP, record it, and play it live.<br />
Again, failed.</li>
  <li>Keep a dream journal and experiment with lucid dreaming<br />
I have been doing this, funny enough. It’s been almost two months now since the first entry in my journal.</li>
  <li>Participate in NaNoWriMo<br />
I’ve replaced this goal with the short stories one and changed the time to the last three weeks of December due to time constraints. Failed.</li>
  <li>Continue blogging here<br />
I have to admit that I haven’t been as active on my blog, but I’m still updating. Yea, success.</li>
  <li>Study history of pop music<br />
done best by listening to 2 or 3 albums a week
Well, it’s a win-lose situation. I’ve broadened my spectrum of listening to the history of hip-hop and metal so far. Albums, no. Pop music, I think I get enough of it as it is. Failed.</li>
  <li>Tweet everyday with a new vocab word (Probably for <a href="http://artwiculate.com/">artwiculate</a>)<br />
Again, no need for an explanation. I’ll try some other form of this in the future. Thanks to this goal, I have been put in a strange twitter list. Failed.</li>
  <li>Write a screenplay for a short film or web-series<br />
Ha, I think I actually remember writing this, then regretting it. Failed.</li>
  <li>Write a proposal to pitch to VCs (or other people) of a live broadcast studio at low costs on the internet<br />
Well, I’ve learned a lot about VCs this summer. Funny that, but this idea has completely morphed into a new idea with plans in the future. I hope to tell more as the idea manifests itself. For now, it’s a failed project.</li>
  <li>Reach goal of 100 podcast reviews (I’m around about 60 now)<br />
The blog is defunct, and people still chyme in to write me requests. It is still up in the air whether or not this will ever happen. Failed.</li>
  <li>Read David Allen’s Getting Things Done and implement it in my daily routine<br />
It took me forever to reach this one, but somehow I got to it in October.</li>
  <li>Master a different language<br />
Not just yet. I’m going to be working with German for a study abroad trip next year. I’m going to try my best to deconstruct and attain some fluency or at least conversational level German. Failed.</li>
  <li>Make a home-brewed electronic device<br />
Overlooked this one. I think it’s time to reconsider this one next year. Failed.</li>
  <li>Pass my GWR<br />
Yup, passed this one. I forgot this was even a goal.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="final-verdict">Final verdict:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Success = 5 (22.7% Success rate)</li>
  <li>Failed = 17 (77.3% Failure rate)</li>
  <li>Goals that have changed = 5 (Same as successes)</li>
  <li>Goals I no longer hold interest in = 6</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess this year has taught me there’s not enough days to do everything I want. Plus, with reading more, I’ve discovered something in myself; I need to diversify myself and gain some sort of creative engine again. This new idea of mine really comes from this <a href="https://elizabethonline.com/blog-stay-out-of-school/2016/9/30/you-cannot-sing-if-you-cannot-cook">blog post</a> I read from <a href="https://elizabethonline.com/blog-stay-out-of-school/">Elizabeth King</a>. It’s going to be a theme for next year, as I wrap up this blog post.
Happy holidays, and keep checking for holiday updates.</p>
