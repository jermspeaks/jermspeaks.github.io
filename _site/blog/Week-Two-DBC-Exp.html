  <p>Fireworks from Chicago Rooftop</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hi! This is week 2 of my harrowing escape to bootcamp at Dev Bootcamp (DBC). It’s around this time where my cohort and I are finding our standing after mock assessments. The hardest part is to really catch up to the material because so much is thrown at you everyday. However, that’s also a blessing in disguise because this is training my brain for more difficult challenges ahead. Because of the enormity of work over the past two weeks, I’ll cut it short here. Hope everyone’s had a happy fourth of July.</p>
