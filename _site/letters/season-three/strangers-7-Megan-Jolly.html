<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello letter friends,</p>

<p>This is my last letter for the series, “Seven Degrees of Strangers”. If you haven’t followed the journey, you can check it out on <a href="http://www.craftbyzen.com/letters/season-three/">my website</a>. For the past 6 weeks, I’ve written about 6 different people I talked to one degree of separation apart.</p>

<p>For those of you who may have noticed an error, the phrase is six degrees of separation, not seven. I would like to say I did that on purpose. I didn’t. I could have lied and said this is to close the loop. To be frank, I was deluded by my own title, I thought this would be a great experiment.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Raina chose a wonderful person last. Someone with a perspective I don’t have, yet we had a fantastic conversation.</p>

<h2 id="enter-megan-jolly">Enter Megan Jolly</h2>

<p>Megan lives in Portland and met Raina through a basketball camp Raina’s husband was starting. I believe Raina chose to ask me to speak with Megan because Megan’s legally blind. She has Leber’s disease, a mitochondrial defect that affects the optic nerve and  can lead to blindness. Men are more prone to blindness from this recessive trait, and Megan is one of the unlucky ones in the gene pool. She found out in 2016 when she was getting a new perscription for her glasses. That was subsequently the last time she drove.</p>

<h2 id="going-blind">Going Blind</h2>

<p>Megan isn’t completely blind. She’s got no central vision and about 45% of her peripheral vision. Before her diagnosis, Megan’s life was playing soccer, working in non-profit land, hanging out with friends. And after the diagnosis, Megan still does many of the same things, but some activities are a lot harder. Since Megan doesn’t drive, she relies on public transportation. While service is good in Portland, it takes longer to travel. Also, Megan can’t do some of her finances, so her friend became her power of attorney since the banking website she’s supposed to use has poor accessibility support.</p>

<h2 id="oregon-commission-for-the-blind">Oregon Commission for the Blind</h2>

<p>As I was doing some follow-up research about the organization, I ran across this quote. “The real problem of blindness is not the blindness itself—not the acquisition of skills or techniques or competence. The real problem is the lack of understanding and the misconceptions which exist.” It’s from the National Federation for the Blind, and I hope you takeaway how blindness doesn’t strip who you are.</p>

<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who helped me with this project. This wouldn’t be possible without all of you readers who have stuck with me, even while I went through a few months hiatus. It’s time for me to re-read Steven Pressfield’s “The War of Art”. First, I’d like to recognize Megan Gebhart whose blog turned book, 52 Cups of Coffee, inspired me to write this short series.</p>

<p>Of course, I’d like to call out every person I got to interview. To my good friend, Simon, who helped kick off this series and being kick-ass at what he does and reminds me how much potential we have. To the fantastic Evan whose illustrations elevates the writing and logo that signifies the connections between all of us. To Joe for being such a great storyteller and having such a great philosophy on life. To Mary who gave me a phone call earlier this year and continues to remind me how much connections matter. To Julie for writing a book that read after and use her last concept as a mantra for life. To Raina for waiting patiently for my piece to come out and for reaching out and being a champion. To Megan for showing me a part of life I rarely get to see. You all have been great guests, and I thank every one of you.</p>

<p>And I thank my family and friends for sticking with this series. Whose feedback has inspired me to continue writing. And maybe had to stick around and were forced to listen to me talk about all of my guests. Thank you. You’re the best.</p>

<!-- ## Enter Saqib Hassan

Saqib is a co-founder of TrainingFolks. Training folks helps with training services for businesses. He works with clients them with different aspects training. For example, it may be to update training material after a merger. Or it may be to train people on new... 

Then Saqib turned the tables around. He asked me why am I doing this. After an explanation of the themes of connections and communication, he told me it's simple. Networking 101: find people, talk to them, and figure out what you can offer them and what they can offer you. 

As simple as that premise is, it took our conversation to the purpose of connecting. Saqib doesn't know how, but he found someone through LinkedIn because this person had a particular set of skills he was looking for. He's echoing what I've been hearing for a long time, the cycle of giving and taking.

To Saqib, the person connecting needs to understand their offering. This is where I stumbled a lot. By interviewing Saqib, I did not offer much. I think 

Saqib wasn't interested in telling me life stories. Instead, he asked the purpose of the conversation. Our conversation became intwined as to why I wanted to talk to Saqib. I stumbled a bit, fumbling around trying to understand what this entire series has been culminating to.

### Give and Take

To Saqib, the value proposition must be there in order to reach out. Because Raina and Saqib clicked working on a project doesn't necessarily mean my conversation with Saqib had a purpose. I understand this and had little value proposition. 

To say the conversation was a waste of time would not be true. I took some value in it. I understand Saqib's view on networking. Networking is an exchange of goods and services. This can fall in the form of finding business partners, selling products, making friends, finding lovers. 

Interviews are rarely a two way exchange of information. I expected an inteview and received a conversation. Saqib helped me understand this, although this will be anti-climatic for all of you. 

I disagree when Saqib tells me it's much harder to connect with a second or third connection. In this series, I think this contridicts his earlier remark of making sure you understand your offering. If you can do that, connecting really isn't as difficult as it's made to seem.

## Takeaway message

Have a purpose for reaching out to someone. Understand what you're offering them and what they can offer for you.

### Series Conclusion

I'm at a crossroad. I don't want this series to end with a conversation about the purpose of communication and connection, but at the same time, this brings it to a full circle. My conversation with Saqib ends this series by informing me I need to be purposeful with my actions. And Saqib did not want to share life stories. 

"Not everyone's interested," is my conclusion. And to Saqib and everyone else, I'm sorry this may not live up to the series. But I'm fine with this. Life doesn't give you all the answers, and some people really don't have much to offer when I'm not looking for those things they do offer. 

As I'm reflecting on my conversation with Saqib, I'm also reflecting on the journey I've taken with this. I didn't think it would take me this far to begin with. After talking to Simon, I didn't think the second person would be interest in participating in this project, let alone the sixth person. There are nuggets of wisdom from every person I've interviewed. Wisdom like "How do I talk to clients?" "How do I go about resolving my childhood trauma?", "What is the value in putting myself out there?". 

I'm glad i was able to talk to everyone along the way in the journey I did. Would I do this again? No. But I find the path along the way helps me in pursuing connections in the future.
