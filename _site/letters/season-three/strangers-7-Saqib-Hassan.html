<!-- ## Enter Saqib Hassan

Saqib is a co-founder of TrainingFolks. Training folks helps with training services for businesses. He works with clients them with different aspects training. For example, it may be to update training material after a merger. Or it may be to train people on new... 

Then Saqib turned the tables around. He asked me why am I doing this. After an explanation of the themes of connections and communication, he told me it's simple. Networking 101: find people, talk to them, and figure out what you can offer them and what they can offer you. 

As simple as that premise is, it took our conversation to the purpose of connecting. Saqib doesn't know how, but he found someone through LinkedIn because this person had a particular set of skills he was looking for. He's echoing what I've been hearing for a long time, the cycle of giving and taking.

To Saqib, the person connecting needs to understand their offering. This is where I stumbled a lot. By interviewing Saqib, I did not offer much. I think 

Saqib wasn't interested in telling me life stories. Instead, he asked the purpose of the conversation. Our conversation became intwined as to why I wanted to talk to Saqib. I stumbled a bit, fumbling around trying to understand what this entire series has been culminating to.

### Give and Take

To Saqib, the value proposition must be there in order to reach out. Because Raina and Saqib clicked working on a project doesn't necessarily mean my conversation with Saqib had a purpose. I understand this and had little value proposition. 

To say the conversation was a waste of time would not be true. I took some value in it. I understand Saqib's view on networking. Networking is an exchange of goods and services. This can fall in the form of finding business partners, selling products, making friends, finding lovers. 

Interviews are rarely a two way exchange of information. I expected an inteview and received a conversation. Saqib helped me understand this, although this will be anti-climatic for all of you. 

I disagree when Saqib tells me it's much harder to connect with a second or third connection. In this series, I think this contridicts his earlier remark of making sure you understand your offering. If you can do that, connecting really isn't as difficult as it's made to seem.

## Takeaway message

Have a purpose for reaching out to someone. Understand what you're offering them and what they can offer for you.

### Series Conclusion

I'm at a crossroad. I don't want this series to end with a conversation about the purpose of communication and connection, but at the same time, this brings it to a full circle. My conversation with Saqib ends this series by informing me I need to be purposeful with my actions. And Saqib did not want to share life stories. 

"Not everyone's interested," is my conclusion. And to Saqib and everyone else, I'm sorry this may not live up to the series. But I'm fine with this. Life doesn't give you all the answers, and some people really don't have much to offer when I'm not looking for those things they do offer. 

As I'm reflecting on my conversation with Saqib, I'm also reflecting on the journey I've taken with this. I didn't think it would take me this far to begin with. After talking to Simon, I didn't think the second person would be interest in participating in this project, let alone the sixth person. There are nuggets of wisdom from every person I've interviewed. Wisdom like "How do I talk to clients?" "How do I go about resolving my childhood trauma?", "What is the value in putting myself out there?". 

I'm glad i was able to talk to everyone along the way in the journey I did. Would I do this again? No. But I find the path along the way helps me in pursuing connections in the future.
