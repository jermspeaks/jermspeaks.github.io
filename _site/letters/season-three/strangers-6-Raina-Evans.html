<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<!-- 
Welcome to the Jear Bear Letter's penultimate letter of the series "Seven Degrees of Strangers". If you've just started reading this series, I interview a stranger one degree of separation at a time. And you should check out [old letters from this series on my website](http://www.craftbyzen.com/letters/season-three/). 

Sorry it's taken so long to get to this letter. There have been a number of life hiccups, like finding and starting a new job. Sometimes, life gets in the way and you have to drop some things. But now I'm picking it back up to present two last letters.

This week, I'm presenting a conversation I had with Raina Evans.  -->

<p>If you’ve been keeping up with me for this long, that means I have some loyal readers out there. Hi, it’s been a while. Haven’t spoken about this project in forever. I’ve had this aching feeling of completing this project for months. Every time I would start, I’d get distracted by something else. A new job, obligations, travel. Needless to say, I had trouble with time management for creative pursuits.</p>

<p>And now I’m back. Ready to tell you about the last two people I interviewed for “Seven Degress of Strangers”. This week, I’ll recall a conversation I had with Raina Evans, last September. Yikes. Raina, if you’re reading this, I’m truly sorry this took so long.</p>

<h2 id="enter-raina-evans">Enter Raina Evans</h2>

<p>After speaking with Julie, I asked for someone diverse, with a varied background. Enter Raina Evans.</p>

<p>Raina and Julie’s ex-husband used to work for a youth organization in the mid to late 90s. Her daughter and Julie’s oldest son used to play together and were the same age.</p>

<p>On the day I spoke to Raina, she had finished a nice brunch with her daughter and grandchild at Black Bear Cafe. Raina was radiant. This woman was full of energy, excited to talk about what she does and what she’s accomplished.</p>

<p>Raina’s worn many hats. She is the current owner of Ready to Rent, a program to train residential renters. As the owner of the program, Raina trains the instructors of this program. After speaking to Raina, I only found a glimpse of how rich her life really is.</p>

<p>She adds so much detail through her language and exuberance of how she talks. It showed in our conversation in the tiniest details, like her mention of how her brunch went. I knew this was going to be an interesting conversation.</p>

<h2 id="ready-to-rent">Ready to Rent</h2>

<p>In the early 2000’s, Raina was working at the Portland Housing Center. This organization she worked for ran a training program for first time renters. They called the program “Ready to Rent”. In 2006, the board wanted someone to run this program. They asked around, but couldn’t find someone with the right skill set. They kept getting candidates with social work backgrounds. What they were looking for than management and marketing backgrounds. Putting two and two together, and they looked at Raina’s background and saw a great fit. But the first time the board asked her, Raina refused. They came back a few days later and asked again. And again, she refused. On the third try, Raina relented. She just got married a few months prior and lost her position on the board. The new marriage came with their own children. Raina thought this was the third time, and perhaps this might be her calling.</p>

<p>Raina gave the board one year to try it out. And then it turned to giving it a second year. By the third year, Raina stayed at this position. But the board came back and told Raina they would be cutting the program. The board chair asked Raina if she might want to run “Ready to Rent” as a private entity. Ready to Rent’s curriculum is one of a kind. There isn’t one quite like this. Raina, with the support of the chair, spun this out on her own. To her surprise, the program grew. A lot. Raina took this operation across the US and Canada. She trains instructors to be certified in the program.</p>

<p>By 2010, Raina took the IP from the commission. She’s been working at this for a decade and still going strong.</p>

<h3 id="memorable-moments">Memorable Moments</h3>

<p>I asked Raina what were some memorable moments she’s had training adults. She gave me two stories.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>On the big island of Hawaii, the mayor of Hawaii country was amongst the group Raina trained. Raina doesn’t jump into the material on the first day of training. She focuses instead on how adults learn. After that first day, Raina jumps into the program.</p>

<p>The mayor spoke with Raina after the class was over and said, “Now I get it. We’ve been communicating wrong this whole time. We’ve been communication with our people and with clients the wrong way. You taught us how adult learners learn.” The course changed the policy on communicating with others. This was an eye opening experience for the mayor.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Raina came out to teach in Sacramento, California. During the first week, she taught city and county workers. The second week, she taught a consortium of agencies. Today, about 100 trainers in Sacramento delivers this curriculum. But it didn’t stop there. The woman who first asked Raina to teach in Sacramento moved to another county. She asked Raina to teach people in the county over as well.</p>

<p>Raina continues to thrive by a viral effect. The cirriculum is effective from years of iteration. People take away a lot from the course. All in all, Ready to Rent continues to grow through word of mouth. As Raina puts it, “the program markets itself.”</p>

<p><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>Raina’s niece and boyfriend had a baby shower. The family’s mother came out from the other side of Mt. Hood. Essentially the boonies. They may be the only African American family in their town.</p>

<p>The mom was talking about how they send clients to Ready to Rent. She asked Raina if she heard of it, and Raina revealed she’s behind it. “You are ‘Ready to Rent’?” Raina proves word of mouth is one of the best techniques in marketing. Also, Raina’s right. The curriculum is so good, it does market itself.</p>

<h3 id="class-evaluations">Class Evaluations</h3>

<p>One of the requirements of teaching the course is distributing class evaluations. At the end of the course, students fill out class evaluations and get sent back to Raina. This helps Raina gauge how the students and teachers are doing and if the classes are of quality. One of the questions on this evaluation asks the students how prepared they are in renting. The students always respond with similar answers: Yes, they are ready.</p>

<p>There’s also freeform text where the students can give back general feedback. Raina was blown away when she read the student “no longer has to lie on housing apps”. Ready to Rent was taught in prisons, and the inmate had that profound realization.</p>

<p>To circle back to the viral effect, 80% of evaluations show they would recommend the course to a friend. Raina often sees the same feedback. “Everyone needs to take this course”. Former students bring “Ready to Rent” up at church, AA meetings, at work. All over.</p>

<h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>

<p>Raina’s takeaway message was “you never know what your calling is. Leave yourself open to everything”.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>After each interview, I realize I want to continue the conversation. Each person I’ve spoken to for this newsletter have more stories to tell. Many more than could ever fit in a one hour time slot or 300 page biography. And, as I truncated an hour-long interview for you, dear reader, I have no doubt I could write so much more.</p>

<p>At the end of our conversation, Raina told me about a talk show she hosted on local broadcasting. This was back in the late 80’s, and it was called “Let’s Talk with Raina”. Raina was talking about inclusion and diversity. I have a huge interest on teaching diversity to youth and Raina and I could talk for hours about this.</p>

<!-- 

Finished having lunch at Black Bear Diner

July training days - online training

Julie - ex-husbnad (Jonathan) - worked at the same youth organization in the mid to late 90s. Friends through work.

Their eldest son is the same age as Raina's daughter

Raina left that organization, worked at a couple different organization until she worked on the board of the Portland Housing Center. The organization helps home owners. 

She started managing education classes to help rental housing. Organizaion wanted Raina to fill the role. Less candidates with social services, more to program management and training.

Portland Housing Center - ready to rent, the board really liked it. They asked Raina three times before she agreed to lead the class. She gave it a year, which turned to 3 years. At the end fo the 3rd year, the board decided to stop the program. PHC's director told Raina she should run it on her own. This was around the time she just got married.

In 2006, blended family. Took curriculum to teach other teachers. Curriculum took two years for the staff and writers to put together.

Licensed the curriculum to other organizations. 

2007 - possession of curriculum of "Ready to Rent"
2010 - gave copyright to Raina's org

## Takeaway message

You never know what you're calling is. You should be open to everything.


## Notes

grandma breakfast -> grandson + daughter = loving them

Black bear cafe, western us, all over California

be anywhere to work <- that's how Raina operates

Training online
Take your work anywhere

How she met Julie

Her ex-husband and Raina worked for same youth organization years ago, back in the mid to late 90's

Oldest son + her daughter same age - played a lot together

Confusing to Raina -> training -> what she does

Julie's husband Johnathan left the organization. Jumped around other organizations. Eventually worked on the board of the Portland housing center. Homeowners

They had an education class called "Ready to Rent"

Barriers to get into rental housing. 
Moved -> head of this class.

They tried to find a replacement but kep getting social services, not someone with a program management / education training background.
No: Social Services
Yes: program management / education training background

Eliminating position for Raina at the board
board asked Raina to head "Ready to Rent"

First time: said no
Second time: said no
Third time: said yes

With some conditions
- evaluate and run for one year and see where they are

Ran it for three years
  Rental education no more, board sought to eliminate the program and Raina's position
  But one of the executive board members asked her to run it as an independent entity

Explore with Raina (2006), she was recently married in november 2005 with a blended family

No startup funds, no budget

Cirriculum is one of a kind. 2 years to write and put it together
For 3 years, licensed it to other organizations. Calling for it, put it on the shelf

Since 2007 - 2010, Ready to rent on license
After 2010, has CC and ownership to Raina

Spends less time marketing
Spends more time on training staff and licensing -> instructor certification

On-site training all around the US and Canada: CT, RI, HI, Canada, CA, NC

Lifework:
  background in communication, PR, marketing

Education:
  wheelhouse = non-traditional educators - how to teach. She loves it!

1,000s of people across US/ Canada

Road path -> middle school, high school, steward of doing this

elementary to college = teaching is a huge difference

90s / early 00s = middle schoolers
  - can morph, has some skill

HS - think they know everything. Have to get "adult" with them

Adults don't like diversity training

MS / HS much easier to understand diversity training (in WA)

Genre of teaching to different groups in high school

### Memorable Moments

training group in big island, HI
Talking about teaching

First day of training is spent on teaching. Later the students get it.

Adult learning principles

Director of city and county of HI after first days said "Now I get it. We've been doing it the wrong way"
  about communicating to each other

"We've been communicating with our people, with clients, the wrong way. You taught us what adult learners needs. How they learn."

Reconfigure how to communicate. Now put the right communication piece"

Memorable training

Sacramento, CA 2015

County in SAC, 2 weeks

Week 1: 30 city + county of sacramento employees
Week 2: 30-32 consortium of agencies

Both groups want training

~100 trainers in SAC delivering this cirriculum

Woman moved the county over and referred a new group of agencies to train! (word of mouth)
She also was the one to open it up to the consortium and wanted it in SAC

She led the call for training

CA has tons of trainees

People who take class

3 ppl as renters were taught homeowning, now are instructors

Class evaluations (feedback)
- never seen negative evaluations
- students get it

Prisoners taught this -> evaluation

Con you get housing now?
Response: No longer have to lie on housing applications

Feedback & evaluations - original curriculum

through responses, see changes in behavior, and measures effectiveness

As part of teaching the curriculum, evaluations are sent back to Ready to Rent
(1) how students are doing
(2) how instructors are doing

80% of evals - Would you recommend to friend. Answer: "Everyone needs to take this class"

Outreach - word of mouth
email - staffers (5 ppl)
last 3 months - call from agencies where it was mentioned in meetings
e.g. AA, Dept of behavioral health

Heard from meeting (mentions)
publicity, client needs for housing

Niece + BF: had 1 year old baby. At the baby shower, their mom from mt. hood (Madras OR) heard about the program ready to rent. Told Raina, you're behind it?!

She may be the only African American family in the area. Maybe works in corrections.

We send them to classes (her clients)

How do we connect with people?

Takeaway: you never know what your calling is. Leave yourself open to everything

Next participant: 2 ppl in mind

Diversity Curriculum - late 80s

hosted local tv talk show - interview people - talk show formal

"Let's talk with Raina"
