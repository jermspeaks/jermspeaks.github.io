<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<!-- How does the concept of weak ties from Malcolm Gladwell's book on
connections apply here? -->

<h2 id="enter-evan-roar">Enter Evan Roar</h2>

<h3 id="how-does-evan-know-simon">How does Evan know Simon?</h3>

<p>Evan is close friends with Simon as long as he can remember. Their families were
part of the same club. Their siblings went to school with each other. And even
though Evan’s family moved to North Carolina, both families keep in touch.</p>

<p>Evan says he goes back to Minnesota once or twice a year.</p>

<h2 id="design-dimensions">Design Dimensions</h2>

<p>Design Dimensions is a design firm specializing in exhibition design. Evan works
there as a designer alongside his boss. He has been there for a year and has
designed exhibits all over, including [EXAMPLES HERE].</p>

<h3 id="how-did-evan-land-a-job-at-design-dimensions">How did Evan land a job at Design Dimensions?</h3>

<p>As a sophomore or junior at NC state, Evan worked as a student ambassador
running events for the school. Finishing his tasks less than the allotted time, which he said was many hours, he helped doing other tasks. There was a need to create posters, and when he worked on the graphical work, he discovered a propensity to do more.</p>

<p>Slowly, he did more poster work, eventually building a portfolio. He used lynda.com to learn the Adobe Suite. And graphic design was not his major. It was business development. He had stumbled into this field.</p>

<p>Come post-graduation, when it was time to find a job, Evan submitted his portfolio to Design Dimensions. Evan had just started @ an Accounting firm when the design company called him in. He thought it would be worth it as his current role was an internship that may not hire him full-time, so he went for the interview. The design company took a chance with Evan. His boss interviewed him not only on the merits of his portfolio, but also his taste in music and relationship to his college fraternity. His boss went to the same school and was in the sorority with close ties to Evan’s fraternity. And being in a small design firm, his boss wanted to make sure she could work well with her future co-worker, one of the requirements was to be able to blast music in close quarters. So even though Evan was not a design student, he got the job.</p>

<p><em>Footnote</em> there’s a similar story I’ve read in Jessica Hische’s book, “In Progress”, in which she describes her desk and workspace she shares with. Designers are selective in who they choose to keep.</p>

<h3 id="what-have-you-learned-working-there">What have you learned working there?</h3>

<p>The short answer is a lot. One year is a lot to go through many clients. For example, last Monday, Evan could be juggling through 10 clients. His strong point is graphic design.</p>

<p>Museums he works with generally comes up with the content and its the designer’s job to make it presentable.</p>

<p>It’s Evan’s job to take a given space, like venues, museums, and exhibition spaces, and design the entire experience, from the look and feel, to the overall experience. It’s a small office and very long standing over the past few decades. The original founder still comes by even though he is in his late seventies.</p>

<p>It’s only recently he’s been doing more back and forth with the client.
Normally, the client comes with the specs and the designer can work with it.
Occasionally, the client also wants to be the designer and put their two cents into it. It reminds me the first iteration of your work will not be your last.
Rarely is that the case with freelancing either.</p>
