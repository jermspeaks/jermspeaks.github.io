<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Evan prefaced Joe is someone who’s walked an unconventional path. Before diving
into the interview, I glanced over Joe’s butcher shop’s website. The only thing
that stood out to me was the shop was in Carmel, Indiana. I’ve never been 
there, and was curious to hear how Joe’s path took him there.</p>

<h2 id="enter-joe-lazzara">Enter Joe Lazzara</h2>

<p>Joe Lazarra is Evan’s father’s, Charlie’s, best friend. Having nothing to 
really go off of, I let Joe talk about himself and how he ended up where he is 
now. Joe didn’t disappoint. If you ever talk to him, he’s a magnificent 
storyteller and has a very solid sense of self.</p>

<p>Joe took me back to his Sicilian heritage. Generations of his family was built 
around the food. That’s where it all starts. His family’s bond is around food. 
His eldest brother’s 18 years older than him, yet his father got all 6 of his 
siblings through college.</p>

<p>In college, Joe studied Quantatative analysis, which during the mid to late 
80’s, was the thing to study and get a great job. Joe started off working at a 
software consulting job. Certain events led Joe into the telecomm business 
when his job took an unexpected turn. At the software job, the HR manager took 
the 401k pension to Florida and used that money to deal or smuggle drugs. The 
DEA and FBI took whiff, and Joe exited as soon as he heard, disentangling 
himself from that mess.</p>

<p>He was in sales with GTE selling to areas around the U.S. telecomm services. 
That was until Verizon bought them out. He worked for small business, 
start-ups, VCs, doing early work in VOIP and selling high speed Internet to 
homes. He was a top executive at one of these companies until the 2001 
attacks, and a struggle tech recession from the dot com bust, made it 
unreasonable to continue as head of sales. Surprisingly, that company still 
exists even with the executives gone 16 years later. It’s a sign the employees 
are more important to keep the ground running.</p>

<p>After that, he consulted for a few years. But Joe grew tired on traveling 
around. One side-effect of traveling is Joe really loved food, and seeked out 
good restaurants. He was a frequent to some up and coming places, 
restauranteers thought he was a food critic.</p>
