<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<!-- 
- How did Mary introduce me to Julie?
 -->

<p>If this is the first time you are reading this series, welcome. This is a series about communication, connections, and perspectives. My last interviewee, Mary Aipoalani, gave me too many choices on who to interview next. I was in choice paralysis until I received this text from Mary. “You need to connect with her. I just told her about you.”</p>

<p>Attached to the text was a VCard, a digital business card that makes it easy to add them to your contacts list. Or at least in theory it’s supposed to be easy. I had the complication of incompatible file formats. Android phones hate Apple’s VCards attachments. If you ever run into this problem, save the VCard text to a computer and add it to your contacts online. And if you’re a iOS or Android developer, please make this integration easier. Thanks.</p>

<h2 id="enter-julie-valenti">Enter Julie Valenti</h2>

<p>Julie is alive, energized by the southern California sun. She harnesses that energy and uses it to help people rewire their brains. Rewire metaphorically. Her hidden agenda is by rewiring brains, people will be more alive. And by being more alive, she hopes people can become contributors and producers in our world. In turn, she hopes people consume less.</p>

<p>Let’s step back for a moment. Who is Julie? She’s a new resident of San Diego. She moved here because she’d rather soak up the sun than live in a cloudy and low-lit place like Portland, Oregon. She lived in Portland for the past 23 years. From Portland’s dreary weather, she developed SAD - Seasonal Affective Disorder. When Julie’s friend invited her to come out to San Diego months ago, she knew she had to move there.</p>

<p>Besides sun worshipping, Julie is the owner of Portland’s Wisdom and Recovery Wellness Center. She works with patients who suffer from confusing childhoods. This is post-traumatic stress disorder in childhood. This is a result of bad parenting. The range varies from parents who were abusive, or neglectful, or emotionally taxing.</p>

<p>Julie’s center has been around for over a decade. Julie has been in practice from much longer. Julie is also an author. She wrote a book called “Knowing How: The 20 Concepts to Rewiring Your Brain” based off her practice.</p>

<h3 id="empty-nest-syndrome">Empty Nest Syndrome</h3>

<p>Julie cites one of the reasons to move to San Diego was to be closer to her youngest son. Her son was the last child to leave home. He moved to Los Angeles, and Julie wanted to be able to visit.</p>

<p>I asked Julie what was a mother’s perspective on empty nest syndrome. Julie explains “empty nest syndrome” is a fancy term for grief. When children are around, the mother produces a bonding hormone, oxytocin. When the children leave the nest, the mother stops producing as much oxytocin. A result of the hormonal change is the same symptoms of grief and loss.</p>

<p>The mother must come to her terms with the life adjustment. When neglected, the result is oftentimes a “mid-life crisis”. She withdraws and re-evaluates herself. When recognized, the mother feels it in her body.</p>

<p>The mother must setup boundaries with her children. The child is in a different place with life, independent from the nest. Part of the re-adjustments Julie talks about is developing boundaries with the children. For Julie, she had a conversation with her son in LA. She asked how often they would talk over the phone, how often they would see each other, how much space they needed from each other. Julie wants to make sure she would not suffocate her child.</p>

<p>I asked Julie about empty nest syndrome for personal reasons. My sister, the youngest sibling, has left the nest. My mother hasn’t been dealing with empty nest syndrome head on. Armed with a better understanding, I am tasked with having a conversation with my mom about empty nest syndrome and grief.</p>

<h3 id="wisdom-and-recovery-wellness-center">Wisdom and Recovery Wellness Center</h3>

<p>Julie works with patients who suffer from PTSD introduced from childhood. She spends every two weeks in Portland to help with logistics for the center. When she’s back in San Diego, she takes clients remote. When Julie is on-site, she is also training staff members.</p>

<p>To be clear, Julie is not practicing traditional psychotherapy. That means, clients do not come in and lay on a couch for an hour every week for the rest of their lives. Julie is a licensed hypnotherapist. She wants her patients to heal and be less dependent of a therapist. Stop going altogether.</p>

<h4 id="neuroplasticity">Neuroplasticity</h4>

<p>“You can’t teach a dog new tricks.” This is not true. Brains are not fixed after a certain age. Recent research shows neurons that fire together wire together. The result is neuroplasticity, an ability to rewire your brain. By taking the time to learn or un-learn, the brain will form neuropathways that forms new habits.</p>

<p>Carol Dweck wrote a book about this called “Mindset: The New Psychology of Success”. In the book, Dweck describes and differentiates between fixed mindsets and growth mindsets. Dweck talks of people with fixed mindsets are less prone to take risks and fail. She talks about how people with fixed mindsets shut down after unable to do specific tasks. On the contrary, people with a growth mindset allow for failure and learn from mistakes and try again. In reality, everyone is a little of both. We allow for failure in some aspects of our lives, growth mindset, and we are set in our ways in others, fixed mindset.</p>

<p>Julie uses this understanding of neuroplasticity to teach her clients they have the ability to change. With some guidance and practice, the client will be able to re-wire their brains.</p>

<h3 id="rewiring-communication">Rewiring Communication</h3>

<p>I had the chance to read Julie’s book on a plane ride from San Jose to St. Louis. The book is for people with a confusing childhood and therapists. I would make the case the book can also be for people who don’t have a confusing childhood. I recognize I struggle with some of the concepts.</p>

<p>The 20 concepts are tools to help arm the reader. Julie writes about each concept by going into examples of how the concept applies. At the end of the concept, she supplies a self-assessment. The self-assessment asks the reader questions. These questions help solidify their understanding of how the concept relates to them. I have not finished through the self-assessments on my first reading, and will return to them.</p>

<p>Many concepts apply to the reader’s efforts in dealing with tough decisions. By giving alternatives to dealing with these situations, the reader can build habits. Or unlearning habits that have been ingrained since their childhood. After reading the book, Julie hopes the reader asks themselves the big questions. What they are doing in the world? Why do they do what they do based off their hardwiring? What they can do different? How to go about doing different?</p>

<p>Betty is at home, making dinner for her husband James. She’s had a stressful day when her car broke down. She wants to ask James about buying a new car when he gets home. Betty hears James come in and welcomes him home. James has a frustrated look on his face and tells Betty he can’t talk now. James proceeds to the living room, sits down, and turns on the television.</p>

<p>Betty’s confused and frustrated. As mentioned, Betty was expecting James to come home and talk to her. Now that her expectations are thwarted, Betty must face her own thoughts and emotions. Betty has yelled at James in the past for similar behavior before. None of the previous encounters have ended well. Betty takes a breath and reviews the 5 part communication formula.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Observation</li>
</ol>

<p>Betty takes an objective view of the situation and reviews the events. Betty was making dinner and she noticed her husband came home. He looked frustrated and told Betty not to talk to him.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Thoughts</li>
</ol>

<p>Betty thinks this is rude. Betty thinks this is a form of rejection, and thinks James doesn’t love her.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Feelings</li>
</ol>

<p>Betty feels rejected, sad, depressed, confused.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Analyze Desires</li>
</ol>

<p>Betty wants James to talk to her when she comes home.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Participate</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that Betty has followed the first four steps, she can recount that to James when they both have calmed down.</p>

<p>“James, I’d like to bring up what happened earlier. I was making dinner and noticed you came home. You looked frustrated and told me not to talk to you. I thought this was rude. I thought this was a form of rejection and thought you don’t love me. I felt rejected, sad, depressed, confused. When you came home, I wanted to be able to talk to you. I wanted your attention because I’ve been alone all day. Are you willing to talk to me when you come home?”</p>

<p>At this point, James could counter with something else. He needs time to calm down from his day at work. The important thing is the conversation has started. Each party can reach a point of compromise. Also, James understands Betty’s perspective, so he is primed with an answer or counter.</p>

<p>With practice, Betty can get better at communicating with others. She can work through her thoughts and feelings and let others know what she is going through. Betty is a metaphor for people who go through similar situations. Betty is a metaphor for situations I’ve found myself in.</p>

<h3 id="adult-responsibility-is-non-negotiable">Adult Responsibility is Non-Negotiable</h3>

<p>Julie grew up in Idaho. Her mother had an addiction to pain killers. Her mother’s addiction affected how her children. Julie’s upbringing and relationship to her mother was toxic. Julie writes how her mother’s dependence to legal drugs created problems at home. When the drugs were there, Julie’s mother was fine. But when the drugs weren’t, Julie’s mother would turn into a different person. Julie thought she had to take care of her mother, and became the caretaker for her mother.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until much later Julie understood the impact. Her relationship with her mother resulted in bad behavior and life choices. For example, Julie was in a relationship where her partner was an addict. Julie played the rescuer to her partner and created a co-dependent dynamic.</p>

<p>Julie made decisions to change her behavior. She studied issues in parent-child relationships. She was able to develop a framework to help her re-wire her brain.</p>

<p>Julie sees traditional therapy as ineffective. Some therapies continue for decades without lasting results. Patients come back, lie on the couch, and talk out their issues to their therapist. Rinse and repeat for years to decades. It feels like all the therapist is there for is someone who will listen, for a hefty sum. Sounds eerily familiar to the co-dependent dynamic.</p>

<p>At the end of the book, Julie’s last concept is “Adult Responsibility is Non-Negotiable”. Say there’s a situation you have had a tough time dealing with. Like having a conversation with a complete stranger. Or getting angry over things out of your control. What do you do now? You take the high road. You act like an adult because you’re an adult. This is my personal take on the book - of being able to liberate yourself. It’s not an easy road for all. For some, it will take time and practice. Julie’s hope is if you’re not able to take on adult responsibility, it is your duty to get to that point.</p>

<h2 id="takeaway-message">Takeaway message</h2>

<p>Julie’s takeaway is to understand and resolve your childhood trauma. Resolution may come in the form of rewiring your brain.</p>

PTSD early childhood 

Sun worshipper, visit San Diego, Hillcrest Area

2 weeks wellness

Just moved recently

Book promotion

Survival = brain
Advise: Don't move to Portland

Julie's lived there for 23 years. The Summer months == July, August, September. Portland recrod last year: 109 degrees F

Julie feels alive in the sunlight. Active as a sun worship

SAD = seasonal affective disorder. Feel good receptors closes. Out of harms way. For survival.

Nueroscience.

The prefrontal lobe - the brain to be more functional. 18% intelligence vs survival brain

SAFE brain

Experience -> what's a need vs a desire (want)
- Need = Maslow's Hierarchy of needs
- Desires linked to dopamine receptors. 

Hormonal recipe -> share

Book writing -> Feeling Good

"Empty Nest Syndrome" is a disguise for grief and loss
- Grief and loss lead to high oxytocin levels, tied with children leaving the home. 
- The mother must come to term with adjustments
- Often tied to "mid-life crisis"
- For children, the have to understand the mother's adjustments. Evokes miral neurons.
- We feel this in our body

Make an action plan

Julie has one son in Portland, one son in LA. She must determine her wants. How much texting, visiting, email/phone call? Negotiate the terms.

The book is for therapists and people confused about their childhoods, and it's to help or need help with it
Confusing because of conflicted attachment.

They are drawn to addiction, escape, PTSD is a reaction of the organism of life being threatened.

Neuroplasticity - healing process. Approached by the 20 concepts. 

Concepts get translated into a methodology. Think / memorize.

Background

Concept
	What we do in the world
	What we do different
	How we do it
	"Ask yourself these questions"

1. Brain / Body
2. Attachment

This is part of the process. Process is split in three parts

1. Understand yourself
2. Recreate yourself
3. What you can do about it (the "how")

The last concept: "Adult Responsibility is non-negotiable"

Traditional psychotherapy costs a lot more money.

Wisdom & Recovery

Julie is a licensed hypnotherapist.

One big takeaway
- Understanding + resolving childhood
- Rewiring

Mentor / Coach to write book -> Angela

Buy her book on Amazon

<!-- ## Notes v2

"This is me. Not trying to impress."

Haven't talked to Mary in quite some time -> confidential

Owns a wellness center in Portland Oregon to help people with PTSD from childhood trauma

Developed own approach, wrote a book

Recently: San Diego - Patio of hotel "I'm going to live here"

Pool, beach, Balboa Park to ride her bike

Bringing clinicians on board at wellness center as Julie starts promotion in San Diego. A few Skype sessions

Book promotion.

Creating realities, manifesting them to move from Portland to San Diego after one visit

Hillcrest Area

5 minutes from little Italy, Marina
10 minutes from the Beach

Excited state: Survival -> calm down to intelligent -> can do anything

Portland for 23 years
- Outrageous to rent / buy in
- Freeways and roads can't support people, increase in traffic
e.g. Seattle, LA, SF
- Winters last 6 yo 7 months long: Icy, rainy, cloudy. Last winter - not going
- 3 months of summer
	- last summer broke records (109)
Sun worshipper - someone who comes alive with sunlight
*In Dark* - inside, sleepy, etc
In these areas, can be diagnosed with SAD - seasonal affective disorder
In brain, SAD

Feel good receptors close in dark environment
- Survival brain: go inside
- Retina to shut down
- Rest, protection, survival
- Unevolved survival brain = where most brain activity is in

2 different brand: subconscious vs conscious
- subconscious: surviving
- conscious: thinking

In the "cold" vs the "heat" receptors = "safe"

Balance - Needs vs. Desires (dopamine), Reward loop
- Tech people to manipulate hormonal receptors
- it's a hidden agenda: to be more alive so we can promote more contributors and producers and less consumers

Grew up in Idaho in a mining town
After HS, plane outta there

The income household

Euguene, OR: house
But racist/white bred

Moved to Portland to raise her family, divorce, leave

Empty nest syndrome

Grief & loss - more oxytocin near children (bonding hormone)

Ocytocin receptors close propels loss
- Most people don't want to feel it (don't want to experience it)
- displace it for something new / fresh (mid-life crisis)
"They should call it grief and loss"
- But it's a nature process

What do the children do?
Mother has to come to terms of what's happening. 
She must make adjustments - talk to child of what she's going through. Evoke compassion and empathy

Mirror neurons

Plan - both children see both
one son in USC. one son in PDX

How often comfortable texting, visiting, phone calls?

"What seems right to you?"

- A couple of weeks

conversation of compromise and negotiation
- How long? how much?
- mother has to be understanding of separation
- making compromise and let go

Book
for: those who need help and those who want to help
the author
conflicted attachments
moving target parents

mother - addict to amphetamines
father - avoidance
children
neuroscience + PTSD

The 5 part Communication Formula (p. 123 - 124)
1. Observation
	"This is what I heard or saw"
2. Thought
	"This is what I think"
3. Feeling
	"This is how I feel"
4. Analyze Desires
	"This is what I want"
5. Participate
	"Are you willing"
	- Open to compromise

React of organism of life theatening -> attachment

Security = good, but not everyone
Neuroplasticity - rewire & heal/amend

Confliction = **think** what concept will help you
Confusion, solved by one of the concepts + better hormones -> make a contribution to society

Each concept: info
- What we do in the world
- Why we do it based off our hardwiring
- What we do different
- How we do it? Ask yourself these questions

First concept is about the Brain & Body

Breakdown the work emotion. [e-motion]. The word contains another word, "motion".
Emotion is feeling, because we are stimulated and have a body response. "gut response"

Second - Attachment Theory

Broken down in three parts:

- Understand yourself
- Recreate same dynamics (the brain refuses to do this on its own)
- Breaking "Bad Habits"
Knowing how: this is what I do when this happens

The last third of concepts of how to do it

Psychotherapy not very effective. 
Client helped Julie develop concepts

Creating a program -> Wisdom and Recovery, The 20 concepts
Wisdom = deep down what you know
Recovery = release your authentic self

- $1,000s for 1,000 hours of therapy
- Therapist as attachment figure (rescuer)
	- Dependent situation
	- As a parent
But Julie wants them to re-wire their brains. Can't have the tools normally
Recovery: create a life, evolve human species, make a contribution to society
"Opporunities" = wake up (hidden agenda)

"Get over it" -> doesn't work. You must re-wire it

Takeaway: 
1. Understand yourself and resolve childhood conflicts
2. Rewire your brain better, be a contributor over a consumer -->
