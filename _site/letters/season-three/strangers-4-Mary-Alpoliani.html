<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I had absolutely no background on Mary Alpoliani when I asked her to be my next interviewee. Joe was taking longer than I expected to get back to me, but when he did, he didn’t disappoint. I called Mary a few days before our interview to schedule the meeting, and immediately, I knew I was going to enjoy our conversation. If you’ve read Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Mary’s a prime example of a super-connector.</p>

<h2 id="enter-mary">Enter Mary</h2>

<p>Mary came from humble beginings in Indiana. She grew up on a farm and her food was her family’s language. She graduated from ?? and her husband and her worked all over. They’ve been traveling around all over the US, selling and managing food products.</p>

<p>When I was talking with Mary, she was driving her daughter to an appointment.</p>

<h2 id="the-game">The Game</h2>

<p>With all of this traveling Mary does, she spends a lot of time eating on her own. She doesn’t eat alone though. She told me about this game she plays when she’s at a restaurant with a bar. She scouts the bar area to see if there are any patrons eating alone. If there is, she’ll sit near them. Once the waiter has given he a menu, she looks over to her neighbor’s plate and ask him or her, “Oh, that looks good. What are you eating?”. Mary’s never had a time where the patron has not answered her.</p>

<p>Now the real game has started. After striking this conversation, Mary’s intent is to see if she can get her patron to offer her a sample from their plate. To Mary’s recollection, every patron has given her food.</p>

<p>I asked if she got to get her daughter to do that. Her daughter spoke up and said she’s done it once.</p>

<h2 id="managing-connections">Managing Connections</h2>

<h2 id="takeaway-message">Takeaway message</h2>

<p>“Stop looking at your glass, get off your ass”. Her daughter was listening to the conversation, and told me she couldn’t say that last word. Which was very cute.</p>
