<h2 id="the-negligence-problem">The Negligence Problem</h2>

<p>My glasses were falling apart. I owned them for 4 years and couldn’t persuade myself to get a new pair. To obtain a new pair, I’d need a new prescription. And being sensitive about my eyesight and didn’t want to face the prospect of the optometrist diagnosing me a stronger prescription.</p>

<p><img src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/b7acb1dd09358f1ed19f16a562a005fc08d42511/images/9a41b8ab-a59d-4f86-8454-973e375cc8c0.jpg" alt="Broken Glasses" /></p>

<p>So I did the insensible. I neglected to replace the pair of glasses. And I had no excuse. I had health insurance. There was a hurdle in my mind I couldn’t jump over.</p>

<p>The hurdle started with facing the news I will have a stronger prescription. Which leads to being deemed legally blind because my eyesight had deteriorated. Which triggered my fear of being blind.</p>

<p>At that point, I’d think about something else. When the topic came up again, I’d repeat this cycle of worry, hesitation, and negligence.</p>

<p>I broke down when bad became worse. On of the nostril pads came off, so I needed a replacement. I came to my senses and figured out the first actionable step.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-the-cycle">Breaking the Cycle</h2>

<p>I went online to determine how to schedule an appointment with an optometrist. My hospital website had had online booking. Bingo.</p>

<p>I went in for the appointment and to my surprise, my eyes were the same as they were 4 years ago. By letting myself slip, I failed to see the absurdity of my own bias. All the moments of worry were for nothing. All the times I wondered what if, wasted.</p>

<h2 id="an-introduction">An Introduction</h2>

<p>We all make mistakes. We all fail to do, or sometimes not do, the important things in life. I want to raise the bar and stop this repetition.</p>

<p>The negligence problem is one of my failures. It’s one of many failures. Each week I’ll break down a different repeated mistake. My aim is to generalize failures common to everyone, although my intent is to write it for my future self if I were to relapse. If this model helps other people, that’s an added benefit.</p>

<p>Bookmark this for later. Re-read often. We’re going to have a fun two months exposing my weaknesses.</p>
