<p>People who run marathons are sadistic. The feet wear down after a dozen or two dozen miles. Full recovery takes a days. Mental capacity gets beat up. Hunger sets in. To say at the very least, this was my state on Sunday. And I’m saying I’m sadistic.</p>

<p>You think after my first marathon, I wouldn’t run again. Despite the critics, I threw myself back in the pool.</p>

<p><em>Critic:</em> “Why would you pay to run?”
The event is an incentive to get in shape. I dragged myself on extended runs because paid to participate.</p>

<p><em>Critic:</em> “But why? You could run on your own?”
I guess so, but I like running in large groups. Plus, I like being catered to by marathon volunteers. In this event, that includes the police.</p>

<p>After the run, I love getting small ego boosts when I tell someone I ran the San Francisco marathon. I get an extra boost when they told me how much of an accomplishment that is. I admit, I’m shallow.</p>

<p><em>Critic:</em> “Are you crazy?”
You should have asked me that the first time around.</p>

<p>The SF marathon is held annually. This year, 27,000 runners took the marathon challenge. I feel proud to have finished under the time limit. But I feel like crap that I made some rookie mistakes. Please don’t make these mistakes.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Run faster than your training pace.</strong>
I thought my pace was 11:45 min per miles. It’s not. I found out my Fitbit can’t measure distance when my strike width is smaller than normal. That difference meant my time was longer than 11:45 min per mile. Of course, if I only use my Fitbit to pace, that doesn’t matter because the references would be the same. But here’s the kicker; I was still running faster than my “training pace”. I screwed up big time and felt miserable by mile 11. Also, I was surprised I was only at mile 11 when I got to that mile marker.</li>
  <li><strong>Run together, alone.</strong> Initially, I ran with my earbuds. For 13 miles, I thought I could drown the pain out with music. Not the case at all. I stopped more often with my earbuds in than without. After mile 15, I was about to find at least one chatting partner until the end of the race. I feel grateful to run into chatty folks. They helped me keep a running pace.  Also, after I took off the earbuds, I heard a ringing in my ears after. Don’t listen to music too loud!</li>
  <li><strong>Train on an irregular schedule.</strong> In addition to running, I was also doing gymnastics strength training. Instead of focusing on running a few miles a day, I took more time contorting myself in strange positions. I couldn’t keep a good routine going during my 2 and a half months of training. My legs paid the price.</li>
  <li><strong>Run with worn out shoes.</strong> I used the same shoes from my first race. 8 months ago. Please don’t do that. My feet hurt unevenly. The right foot hurt more than the left. The traction was all gone. The padding was worn in. For a short distance, that’s fine. For a long distance, it can lead to terrible injuries.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t pack snacks.</strong> I needed an extra snack after my stomach gave way. I left an extra Clif bar in my car and completely regret it at the halfway point. The tail-gaters parked close to the finish line were terrible people. I could have slugged one of them in the face if I had the energy to do it.
Take many caffeine shots. The gel packs are a great boost, but use them sparingly. It turns out they give me cramps. That’s extremely unforgiving when I need to sustain a steady pace. I had a really bad muscle cramp towards the 3rd quarter that I shook it off by running more. It came back in the end when I tried to sprint through the last 0.2 miles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that it’s all said and done, I’m glad I ran again. I got to meet people from all over. I got to suffer with people from all over. I got a lot of cheers from all over.</p>

<p>Someone in the race told me, “Not everyone can do this, you know.” She’s right. Not everyone can run a full marathon. But, you’ll never know if you don’t try. I put myself in the arena, and I hope this is your invocation to begin.</p>
