<p>I’m not smart enough.<br />
I know those watching me<br />
With vindictive eyes<br />
Are judging my wits.</p>

<p>I’ll stumble on something I don’t know<br />
Stuck in an inner maelstrom.<br />
Do I try to figure this out,<br />
Or blame my lack of knowing?</p>

<p>I’m not pretty enough.<br />
My mom told me that.<br />
She believed it,<br />
And it hurt when I believed it</p>

<p>I shy away from woman,<br />
Thinking I’m the beast outside.<br />
But then a compliment.<br />
Am I really ugly?</p>

<p>I’m not rich enough.<br />
I couldn’t buy the next must have.<br />
Wishing I owned more<br />
Wondering the price tag of a new life.</p>

<p>Old Joe’s living paycheck by paycheck<br />
And I’ve got more.<br />
Would it be crazy<br />
To give him a helping hand?</p>

<p>I’m not social enough.<br />
I put on an armor against being vulnerable<br />
And I’m left to my own devices,<br />
But I can’t bare to listen to myself.</p>

<p>Then I wonder why no one will talk to me<br />
Initiate a conversation<br />
Counsel me when I need them the most.<br />
I am alone.</p>

<p>I’m not good enough.<br />
I never was good enough.<br />
This voice inside my head<br />
told me I’m not good enough.</p>

<p>I’m afraid everything given to me<br />
Will be taken away in a heartbeat<br />
And I would’ve wished I could’ve appreciated it<br />
When I still had it.</p>

<p>I’m not available enough.<br />
Family and friends wonder<br />
If I’ll ever make it out.<br />
I wonder too.</p>

<p>I can’t bare to make the time<br />
Because there’s always fires around.<br />
There’s always drama<br />
And there’s just no way I can move things around.</p>

<p>I’m not fit enough.<br />
My belly is too big,<br />
I run out of energy too soon,<br />
And the gym is intimidating.</p>

<p>How could I muster<br />
Bringing myself on the treadmill?<br />
Exercise wasn’t made for me<br />
I’m fat because of genetics.</p>

<p>I’m not happy enough.<br />
All the world is suffering,<br />
So I must also suffer,<br />
Because it’s the proper thing to do.</p>

<p>Satisfaction is for losers<br />
Who don’t know the doom that’s coming.<br />
Woe is me,<br />
Why can’t I just be happy?</p>

<p>I’m not enough.<br />
Given my circumstances,<br />
You can see I’m not enough<br />
You can feel I’m not enough.</p>

<p>I’m told I’m wrong.<br />
How can I believe that<br />
When I can’t feel it inside?<br />
Just believe?</p>

<h1 id="im-enough">I’m enough</h1>

<p>I have enough time<br />
To sit and chat with a dear old friend<br />
Reminiscing about the good old days<br />
And talking optimistically about the future.</p>

<p>I created a space<br />
Where people can come in and out of my life<br />
Whom I can be genuine with<br />
And be amiable.</p>

<p>I am happy enough.<br />
I’ve given myself enough time in the day to meditate,<br />
Joke around with the people I work with,<br />
And I don’t get angry over the little things.</p>

<p>I’ve made peace with God.<br />
There’s a spot for spirituality<br />
And for wholeheartedness<br />
And soft-serve.</p>

<p>I’m content enough with my wisdom.<br />
I know there’s so much I will never understand in the world<br />
And I know there will be those who carve a very selective niche<br />
To study those things.</p>

<p>What matters more is the people<br />
You can share your experiences with<br />
And pass down<br />
From one generation to the next.</p>

<p>I’m rich enough.<br />
In fact, I give back most of what I earned.<br />
Because what’s more important than money or things<br />
Are the experiences we have on this Earth.</p>

<p>I am delighted to have the things in my life<br />
That can draw me closer to those I can’t see everyday.<br />
But I don’t hold on to items like a crutch<br />
Because they are only tools.</p>

<p>I’m healthy enough.<br />
A wise man once said<br />
“What the point of being ultra-healthy<br />
When you can’t even enjoy the time you have here?”</p>

<p>There is no excuse to find time for exercise<br />
When you’ve already incorporated it into your life.<br />
Habits are the foundation<br />
To creating a worry-free life.</p>

<p>I’m pretty enough.<br />
I don’t need to look like a million dollars<br />
And then some<br />
Because I can stare at myself naked in the mirror.</p>

<p>I feel great in this skin<br />
And all of the blemishes it has.<br />
All those blemishes have stories<br />
That I get to share.</p>

<p>I’m enough.<br />
I’ve surrounded my life with family and friends,<br />
Who all encourage me in my endeavors<br />
And make my life rich.</p>

<p>Enough is the baseline<br />
Not a static comfortable point.<br />
We have accepted who we are<br />
And are not afraid to change.</p>

<p>I’ve writing down what I’m grateful for<br />
My life, my health, my family and friends,<br />
The abundance, the emotions, the creativity<br />
And a chance to share it all with the world.</p>
