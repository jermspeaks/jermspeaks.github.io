        <span>Start with a beginner's mind. A beginner's mind is open to new and radical ideas.</span>
        <span>An expert's mind rejects new ideas and sticks to what they know. </span>
        <span>When I quit my job as a medical device engineer and decided to become a web developer, I was afraid of what I was getting myself into.</span>
        <span>But then I remembered this zen concept, "beginner's mind", and it reminded me that hacking and tinkering away at a programming language can be fun with infinite possibilities.</span>

      <span>Through breaking and creating things as a kid, I knew I had the maker spirit inside.</span>
      <span>I decided to go through the Dev Bootcamp program and found myself making again; the coolest thing is to imagine something on Monday, </span>
      <span>and stare at its physical manifestation by Friday. That feeling along with the feelings of frustration, disappointment and sacrifice that comes along with the journey, </span>
      <span>is something I am falling in love with.</span>

    <div class="landing-paragraph">
      <span>But I haven't done it alone. Being talented or an expert at something isn't mutually exclusive to being a great co-worker. </span>
      <span>I've found out through teamwork and management that communication trumps talent. </span>
      <span>The ability to communicate and working well with others that matters more, and I have been working on it during the past few months while being team lead on my projects. </span>
      <span>I learned a kind person, different than a nice person, can tell others they are doing a great job or they need to work on something without sugar coating it.</span>
