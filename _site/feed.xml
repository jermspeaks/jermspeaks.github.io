&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you missed the newsletter last week, I started a new writing series. In this series, I interview one person a week, one degree of separation from the last interviewee. The theme of each talk is about connection and communication. This is the second installment of my series about connections and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last newsletter, I talked to Simon Gondeck, a young Web Developer and Entrepreneur. This week, I’m talking to Evan Roer, Simon’s close friend. We talk about how he landed his design job, working for clients, and what Evan’s favorite font is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-evan-roer&quot;&gt;Enter Evan Roer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I wanted to know about Evan was how did he know Simon? As Evan recalls, he’s known Simon and Sevy, Simon’s twin brother, for as long as he can remember. Growing up, their families were part of the same gourmet club. Years ago, Evan’s family moved to North Carolina. Evan was in third grade, yet the families kept in touch. For example, Evan’s older brother is roommates with Simon’s older brother. And, if Evan’s traveling to Minneapolis, which happens once or twice a year, he’s staying with Simon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan resides in Raleigh, North Carolina. He works for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.designdimension.com/&quot;&gt;Design Dimension&lt;/a&gt;, a design firm specializing in exhibit design for museums. He started this job over a year ago and has an unconventional story on how he got there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;landing-the-job&quot;&gt;Landing the Job&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan was a brand ambassador at North Carolina State University. That means Evan would prepare the university’s recreation center with school events. The school designates brand ambassadors 13 mandatory office hours to do prep work. But as Evan learned, it doesn’t take that long to set up tables and handout merchandise. With this idle time, he noticed peers making posters in the gym promoting upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan wasn’t studying graphic design. He was studying business marketing. He wanted to follow a creative itch and make posters. As Evan puts it, he got to see graphic design in the works. He would create posters, learn the tools from Lynda.com tutorials, and develop a portfolio. With his boss’ permission of course. By the end of Evan’s college career, he had an extensive portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After graduating, Evan was looking for a job. Evan applied to design studios and businesses seeking his skills in Business Marketing. One of those design firms he submitted his portfolio to was Design Dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan got an internship with a tech firm. He said the office was decorated like a Silicon Valley start-up. A week or two later, Design Dimension called him. He thought it would be worth a shot at the interview since his current role may not hire him full-time. It was convenient his internship was five buildings away from the Design Dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan was the only candidate without a design degree. He meshed well with the firm’s lead designer, Betsy, his future boss. She liked Evan’s portfolio, and even more, his tastes and preferences in beer and music. And it helped they both went to the same school where Evan’s fraternity had close ties to Betsy’s sorority. Betsy likes to blast music in the design studio. Whoever she had to work with would have to be tolerant of that. The candidate had to mesh well with her. And Evan sure did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/7_DOS_Evan_Graphic.png&quot; alt=&quot;A scale weighing Evan's decision to be an accountant or designer&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-dimension&quot;&gt;Design Dimension&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a professional designer at Design Dimension? From Evan’s perspective, it sounds like a lot of work. He could be juggling many clients at once. “People don’t like to read long paragraphs”, he tells me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Evan could be working for a Botanical Garden. The job could be to layout a design for explaining photosynthesis. Evan’s work is to take the given space and design the entire experience. Evan knows the exhibitors don’t want to read a barrage of words when they can see pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought back to my recent trip to the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The museum had a forest canopy exhibit. There was some text to go with the massive forest installation. But the text was not important to me. I was in awe of the size of the trees with its intricate details. The text is an example of hidden design, open to the curious but not distracting to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restraint&quot;&gt;Restraint&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a designer means knowing when to restrain. Evan will try to push his client’s brand. For example, a Town Hall, the Opera House in Sumter, NC, or small companies. But if he’s working for an established corporation, like IBM or the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, he will stay within the boundaries of their existing brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restraint also comes to play with dealing with clients. Evan may have clients where his clients want to be the graphic designer as well. The feedback sounds more like barking orders. If he finds himself arguing with a client, and the client is wrong, he has to find a way to come to a compromise. “And that’s what pushes you as a designer”, he tells me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;clients&quot;&gt;Clients&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the clients come with the content. It’s Design Dimension’s job to make it presentable. And the clients are super involved from start to finish. When Evan was working for a “Black History of Wilson” exhibit in Wilson, North Carolina, the clients wanted to pack as much information as possible. But, it doesn’t tell a story. The client is wrong, and it’s Evan’s job to convince them to change their content by selling them on the design idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work can be rewarding. Evan worked on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceandhistory.org/home&quot;&gt;children’s museum in Wilson&lt;/a&gt; that teaches science and history. Before the design firm came in, the museum was outdated, a relic from the 80s. The museum’s administrator secured the funds to update and upgrade the space. and Evan’s team worked with the administrator to come to a good design. When it was all said and done, this space was resurrected, brought back to life with updated science. And for the administrator, her reaction was priceless because she put her heart and soul in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s only recently Evan’s had interactions with the client. A theme from last week’s newsletter was feedback and criticism. I wanted to know how Evan deals with those themes. Evan tells me it pushes you to be better. You have to be able to speak the same language, and rarely does one design iteration is enough. As a great designer, you have to be able to let things go. Even if Evan thinks one of his logos looks damn amazing, the client could reject it and have the whole process start over. Evan’s learned to let that go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan’s takeaway for you is to make connections in life. Everything’s connected in relationship to each other. And to find those and be able to point those out is a fun thing to do. Put yourself out there. Make connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;random-tidbits&quot;&gt;Random Tidbits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After our interview, I hired Evan to create illustrations. Credits to Evan for the letterhead and accompanying illustrations for each letter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evan loves discovering music, new and old. His favorite music festival is Bonnaroo in Tennessee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evan’s favorite font: &lt;a href=&quot;https://typekit.com/fonts/din-condensed&quot;&gt;Din Condensed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the next installment of the Jear-Bear Letters. After a half year 
hiatus, we’re back with a new series called “Seven Degrees of Strangers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title is a play on “Seven Degrees of Separation” where you are at most
seven links away from knowing any random stranger on Earth. So if I met a
stranger on the street, I could trace them to at most seven degrees of
separation until I found a connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next 7 weeks, I will write about the conversation I
had with 7 people, each one degree of separation away. I’ve chosen 
communication as the theme for each conversation, trying to understand what it 
means to communicate to each other and how can we build connections when we 
don’t know the stranger. You’ll get to hear their stories and experiences, and 
how I relate to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-are-you-doing-this-project&quot;&gt;Why are you doing this project?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with a thought about connections. On LinkedIn, you can see
potential new friends who are second or third degrees of separation. I
wondered, who are these people? How does everyone know each other? If I
continue down the path of separations, could I meet someone famous?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in May, while I was conceiving the idea for this series, I went to a talk
with Bill Burnnett and Dave Evans. They are professors at Stanford who wrote a
book called “Designing Your Life”. In their talk, they asked everyone to turn
to their side, speak with their neighbor, and ask them something you need help
with. I turned to my neighbor, we introduced ourselves, and I asked about a
question about appropriative technologies. She didn’t have any tips, but she
knew someone who could direct me to who might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pondered about the interaction for a week. It’s not an everyday feeling for
me to ask for help from strangers. Even though the woman didn’t know someone
directly, she knew of someone who could get me closer to my answer. This
project is my exercise to practice that power of connectedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the series, we’ll find out what connectedness means to other
people. And build a new connection by the end of our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-first-degree-of-separation&quot;&gt;The First Degree of Separation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin this series, I reached out to my friend, Simon Gondeck. He’s an
entrepreneur and web developer for his own consulting company,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mgwebpartners.com/&quot;&gt;MG Web Partners&lt;/a&gt;. Besides catching up with an
friend, I wanted to probe him about starting a company. Simon did not disappoint. In our conversation, he went over that and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-simon&quot;&gt;Enter Simon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon’s a recent grad from the University of St. Thomas with a B.S. in
Accounting. I met Simon three years ago at a software bootcamp. At the time, 
he was on his summer break; he was one of the younger members of our cohort. He clicked with me because I grew up in the Bay Area and he wanted to know if I knew G-Eazy. I didn’t, but I know people who knows the rapper, and Simon kept asking more questions about the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I loved Simon’s enthusiasm. We paired programmed a few times and hung out 
outside of the program. I got Simon to join our final team project where we 
created a social network for grieving. Simon was a total team player and 
whooped my ass into gear when we took a break at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon’s an athlete and spent his college term playing lacrosse player. 
Unfortunately, at the time we were talking, he was recovering from an injury 
when we had the interview. I realize that he’s a person to go to for my 
atheletic questions, so in the future, I’ll be reaching out to him more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/7_DOS_Simon_Graphic.png&quot; alt=&quot;Simon wearing letterman with head as computer screen&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mg-web-partners&quot;&gt;MG Web Partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the software bootcamp, Simon returned to school, living in St. Paul,
Minnesota. He got a part-time job working at a web consulting company. While on the job, he discovered he was compensated far less than the contract stipulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An epiphany came when he was at a yoga class. The studio were in need of a 
website, but all of the contractors they found were out of their budget. Simon and his friend Johnny and he drafted a reasonable offer, and they got their first contract. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mgwebpartners.com/&quot;&gt;MG Web Partners&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-on-starting-a-business&quot;&gt;Lessons on Starting a Business&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before their first contract, Simon and Johnny had little to no knowledge on
how to draft one. They looked online to figure out what a contract should say.
And contracts weren’t the only thing they had to figure out for the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon brought on his twin brother, Sevy, to help out with growing the
business. One of their challenges the team faced was to find more customers.
They drove around the area, going business to business to attract more
customers. They sent out an email campaign last June, seen below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My partners Johnny Mulvahill, Sevy Gondeck and I have started a web design
and development company called MG Web Partners.
We specialize in building businesses remarkable websites that deliver new
customers and drive revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We help three kinds of companies:&lt;br /&gt;
 1. Companies with outdated websites&lt;br /&gt;
 2. Companies with poorly designed websites&lt;br /&gt;
 3. Or Companies that just need a new website&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Most companies fit one of these three scenarios, so if you know of anyone,
please forward them my contact information and I promise we’ll take good
care of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon was hesitant to use email marketing and social media because he viewed
it as mass spam. He didn’t want disinterested people to see his work, and
worse, find he was bombarding friends and family with unnecessary mail. Sevy
convinced Simon to reach out and not worry about that. What you write will
have no interest to some people, and a lot of interest to a few people. You
never know who those people are until you cast a wide net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to Simon talk about his business reminded me how much we learn on the job. When we talked about the details of drafting proposals, Simon talked about the mistakes he previously made. For example, it’s better to draw up a proposal that’s less stringent and allows for flexibility with the client. And it’s better to make the process transparent, so the company uses
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.proposify.biz/&quot;&gt;Proposify&lt;/a&gt;, a website that allows clients to review proposals while also giving the business insight into how their clients are reviewing their proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reflection, Simon says the best strategy that attracted the most customers was word of mouth. In the business of contracting, referrals matter more. Having previous clients tell potential future clients of their work has been more substantial than other techniques. And with every new client, the business learns they learned something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while we’re on clients, how do you communicate with them? Simon has found the best way is to make a phone call or face-to-face. Texting and email interactions are easy to evade and do not convey the same tone as his voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the customer signs off on the proposal and agrees to the timeline, the team gets to work on the project. After the first design iteration or prototype, the team shares it with the customer to review. The team has learned that it reduces the amount of time on wasted work if there’s less guesswork on details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team has worked with clients all over the area. All of the team members have graduated college. Sevy will be leaving the company later this summer to join Deloitte. Simon still plans to growing this company, and getting the formula right before bringing more people on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;questions-for-me&quot;&gt;Questions for me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our conversation about MG Web Partners, Simon turned the tables and asked me a few questions. The benefit of being a first connection is they already know something about you. And in Simon’s case, he’s a long time reader of the Jear-Bear letters, so he had some questions around writing and growing an online presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-writing&quot;&gt;On Writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon asked some advice about creating a writing habit and how to get through
writer’s block. One of his goals is to boost
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mgwebpartners.com/blog/&quot;&gt;his company’s blog&lt;/a&gt; by writing more
frequently. I had a few recommendations for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write a minimum amount every day.&lt;/strong&gt; I choose a page a day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read “Bird by Bird”&lt;/strong&gt; by Anne Lammont, or at least the chapter on “Shitty
First Drafts”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t be afraid to delete.&lt;/strong&gt; This one took me a long time. In fact, while writing this section, I deleted half of my work because it didn’t matter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t expect success.&lt;/strong&gt; As counter-intuitive as it may be, that piece of advice helped me release what I consider terrible writing to my letter friends. A few of those letters have been very well received, like my “Caltrain Suicides” letter and my “Lost Keys” letter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing is just as important as writing.&lt;/strong&gt; And its corallary: &lt;strong&gt;Polishing takes more time than writing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find peers to review your writing.&lt;/strong&gt; Earlier on in my letter writing, I decided to open up each letter for critique.
I reached out on Twitter to see who could be my critique, and a few people
helped me. I’d send a draft out, and they would give me some helpful criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-aways&quot;&gt;Take-aways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Simon what’s one thing he wants people to take away with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over-communicate with clients. It might not always be clear what they want.
Don’t do it over email. Do it over the phone or in-person, if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-week&quot;&gt;Next Week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of each interview, I asked the participant to choose the next person for me to interview. At first, I was loose on criteria, but as I progressed with each interview, I decided to give the participants a question. Who is someone you know you would like to hear an interview from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t get to ask Simon this question, yet he knew intuitively I was looking for someone interesting. And he didn’t disappoint. Hope that’s tease enough for you to continue reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank Simon Gondeck for being the very first participant. Without you, I wouldn’t have started this journey. I’d also like to thank Evan Roer for illustrating the series’ letterhead and an accompanying graphic for this letter. Both of you rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/&quot;&gt;a lengthy comic&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://code-cartoons.com/&quot;&gt;Lin Clark&lt;/a&gt; about WebAssembly,
I thought it might be great to do a deep dive with it.
Thank goodness the folks behind the project have a very nice &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To compile to WebAssembly, we will at the moment need to compile LLVM from source. The following tools are needed as a prerequisite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m on OSX. Check the link for above for your prerequisites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Git&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CMake&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Xcode&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Python (2.7.x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;compile-emscripten-from-source&quot;&gt;Compile Emscripten from Source&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Building Emscripten from source is automated via the Emscripten SDK. The required steps are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git clone https://github.com/juj/emsdk.git
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;emsdk
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./emsdk install sdk-incoming-64bit binaryen-master-64bit
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./emsdk activate sdk-incoming-64bit binaryen-master-64bit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After these steps, the installation is complete. To enter an Emscripten compiler environment in the current command line prompt, type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ./emsdk_env.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This command adds relevant environment variables and directory entries to PATH to set up the current terminal for easy access to the compiler tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, the installation process will take a while. Go make yourself some tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;To conveniently access the selected &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set &lt;/span&gt;of tools from the &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;command &lt;/span&gt;line,  
consider adding the following directories to PATH, or call &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'source  
./emsdk_env.sh'&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do &lt;/span&gt;this &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;you.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compile-and-run-a-simple-program&quot;&gt;Compile and run a simple program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We now have a full toolchain we can use to compile a simple program to WebAssembly. There are a few remaining caveats, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have to pass the linker flag &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-s WASM=1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;emcc&lt;/code&gt; (otherwise by default emcc will emit asm.js).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If we want Emscripten to generate an HTML page that runs our program, in addition to the wasm binary and JavaScript wrapper, we have to specify an output filename with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Finally, to actually run the program, we cannot simply open the HTML file in a web browser because cross-origin requests are not supported for the file protocol scheme. We have to actually serve the output files over HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The commands below will create a simple “hello world” program and compile it. The compilation step is highlighted in bold.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;mkdir hello
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;hello
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; hello.c
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'int main(int argc, char ** argv) {'&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; hello.c
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'printf(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);'&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; hello.c
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'}'&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; hello.c
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;emcc hello.c -s &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;WASM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1 -o hello.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To serve the compiled files over HTTP, we can use the emrun web server provided with the Emscripten SDK:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;emrun --no_browser --port 8080 .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once the HTTP server is running, you can open it in your browser. If you see “Hello, world!” printed to the Emscripten console, then congratulations! You’ve successfully compiled to WebAssembly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how my logs looked when running the program&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;➜  hello-wasm emcc hello.c -s &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;WASM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1 -o hello.html

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-problem-of-rushing-through&quot;&gt;The Problem of Rushing Through&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” — Ferris Bueller’s Day Off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thought crossed my mind. “Am I rushing to die?” I had this thought before. I used to brush it off. The Ferris Bueller quote encapsulates the essence of life, to open up to live. “Am I missing life?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I have an urge to rush to the end. But I risk not thinking through consequences. Rushing through my day, I jump into solutions without thinking about other options and alternative outcomes. When coding, it’s jumping into a solution without thinking about intentions. The implementation could have an immediate problem within the technical details. Or it can have an ethical one. For example, if we have a selection input for gender, you may assume the world operates on a gender binary. That is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To rush is to deny room to be aware. And thats a decision. It’s my decision if I treat work like race to exhaustion. It’s my decision to rush out of the door every morning, without checking if I have my essentials, to catch the early train. It’s my decision if I prolong getting my eyes checked. It’s my decision to stop working out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These scenarios lead to stress. Our bodies give us indication of stress. I have made myself numb to some of it. When the neglect goes too far, the body prevents us from moving forward. I’ve been close to passing out the last time I pulled an all nighter at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks of writing about failures is a reflection of what I’ve neglected in my life and why I stopped paying attention. These letters are to kick myself in the ass and ask, “what I’m going to do about this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say the solution is as simple as slowing down; be present. This is my invocation to begin. I’m standing firm not to neglect the mind and body’s needs. I will let that guide my present intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope is for my future self to read this. My hope is my future self has slowed down. And if he has, please follow up and tell everyone how you did it. And say Bueller was right.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="letters" /><category term="season_2" /><category term="letters" /><summary></summary></entry><entry><title>The Placement Problem</title><link href="localhost:4000/letters/season-two/the-placement-problem.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Placement Problem" /><published>2017-04-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-04-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>localhost:4000/letters/season-two/the-placement-problem</id><content type="html" xml:base="localhost:4000/letters/season-two/the-placement-problem.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/b7acb1dd09358f1ed19f16a562a005fc08d42511/images/f60b85ea-98ea-469f-9942-d15b84fd12f7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jear bear letters admission failure 7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-placement-problem&quot;&gt;The Placement Problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lost-keys&quot;&gt;Lost Keys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the frantic rush of the morning, I’m scrambling many things. I’ve got to shower, eat breakfast, work-out, gather my things for work. In this scramble I inevitably ask myself, “where are my keys?”. If I was wise, they would be in my bag. If I was unwise, I start my descent into madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my key’s perspective, it’s a journey through my room. First, they’ll be in my pocket, ready to open a door. Then they will be on my work table, eager to see me when I’m ready to leave. Then they’ll be on top of the drawer because I’m changing my pants. Then they’ll be god knows where because I was in the middle of another activity and decided to place them wherever was convenient. Then I’ll spend an inextricable amount of time looking for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s times like these I feel helpless to my lack of coordination. I hate my forgetfulness because I lack the foresight to place things in proper places. My keys have a place in my bag, and should always be there. And for the scenario where I don’t bring my bag, it should be in my pocket. But therein lies the problem. If I know I won’t bring my bag, where do I place my keys when I change my pants?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-system&quot;&gt;A System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was working in manufacturing, we implemented a 5 step program to achieving lean manufacturing. One of those steps was setting things in place. In one scenario, say you use a hammer. You take the hammer from its proper placement, use it for a bit, then place it back. To make things easier, one of our technicians placed an outline of a hammer so it is easy to place the hammer in its proper place. The alternative is placing the hammer wherever, which would be harder for the next person who wants to use the hammer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this practice, I should be able to implement it in my personal life. However, I am rarely open to the idea of changing my space. This is prompted by a stubborn attitude that I should remember everything. Added to that, I find moving things around my room to be a chore. And it’s all over when I consider something to be a chore because I’ll try to wiggle out of it any way I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;applied-system&quot;&gt;Applied System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to they keys. Because I lack a system to place my keys in the same place for every scenario, I find it difficult to find them when I’ve placed them in a spot at the time I thought was memorable. I’ve thought about a cubby, or a bowl, but haven’t acted on it. I’m skeptic it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question for those readers. Do you follow a system for placing your things at home. How do you remember where you put your things? Does your system cover all scenarios?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;addendum&quot;&gt;Addendum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest. After drafting this letter, I’m going to give the bowl a try. At least I can cross it off my list if it really doesn’t work. Then it’s back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="letters" /><category term="season_2" /><category term="letters" /><summary></summary></entry><entry><title>The Loneliness Problem</title><link href="localhost:4000/letters/season-two/the-loneliness-problem.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Loneliness Problem" /><published>2017-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>localhost:4000/letters/season-two/the-loneliness-problem</id><content type="html" xml:base="localhost:4000/letters/season-two/the-loneliness-problem.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/b7acb1dd09358f1ed19f16a562a005fc08d42511/images/e95530cf-ed42-42c6-a8c3-6916b74ab552.png&quot; alt=&quot;Admission Failure 6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-loneliness-problem&quot;&gt;The Loneliness Problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bestie has a romanticized version of my life where I am a perky, social butterfly always engaging in social activities. This isn’t true. I spend most days alone when I’m outside of work. I tend to keep my personal life in solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not averse to being around people. I’ve made the decision to be content being alone. My state of solidarity allows me to relish my life in different ways than super extroverts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, I hang out with friends, spend time on the phone with family, and rest around a fire pit with my housemates. To my bestie’s credit, I am a social butterfly at social events. But those are anomalies in my daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t always at peace with this idea of being alone. I grew up in a large household where everyone shared everything. There weren’t enough restrooms to go around and weren’t enough space to spend alone. I was reliant on the people around me; I would get sad if I was alone too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once, my grandmother took forever to pick me up from school. Turns out, she fell asleep at the wheel a few moments after she entered her car. This was before everyone had cell phones, so there was no way of reaching her. I was close to tears waiting at the school steps, contemplating whether I should walk home alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In college, I had times where no one wanted to grab lunch or dinner, so I would go to the campus cafeteria alone. I found the experience miserable because I didn’t socialize with strangers at other tables. My resolution was I brought food back to the dorm and eat in the common area instead where there would always be people hanging out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This habit continued into my early working life. I had some of these same fears eating at restaurants alone. In a conversation with my housemate’s cousin, she told me about her experience after beating cancer. She said she had no worries about being alone anymore. There’s too little time in life not to appreciate good restaurants, so if that means going alone, so be it. Her motto in life made me re-think the way I approach being alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And being alone doesn’t mean one-on-one time with your phone. Quite the opposite. I like to bring a composition notebook and write or draw if I’m in a restaurant. Or people watch. Or talk to the waiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on a business trip this past week. There was two days there was no one around to grab dinner with. I’ve used the “alone” mantra to justify eating alone. It was a great experience because I got to talk with a sushi chef and an bar tender about their experiences. Also, there was a lot of people watching. So the big lesson learned is not every activity alone has to be depressive. Look past your ego, suck it up, and enjoy yourself alone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="letters" /><category term="season_2" /><category term="letters" /><summary></summary></entry><entry><title>Show Your Work - A Manifesto</title><link href="localhost:4000/blog/show-your-work.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Show Your Work - A Manifesto" /><published>2017-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>localhost:4000/blog/show-your-work</id><content type="html" xml:base="localhost:4000/blog/show-your-work.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;show-your-work&quot;&gt;Show Your Work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s meaningful to you, share it with the world.
If it means something to someone else, your work has legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every life and creation can be destroyed. Your work is no different.
If you set your work free, your work can be crushed.

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-problem-with-the-rider-and-the-elephant&quot;&gt;The Problem With the Rider and the Elephant&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emotional mind is an elephant and the reasoning mind is the elephant rider. The rider has limited control over the elephant. The elephant is heavy and not always willing to listen to the rider. The rider might not listen to the elephant and demand the elephant follow orders by sheer will. The internal conflicts come when neither can work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I thought age tames emotion. But after years of watching my dad get angry at little things, I threw that assumption in the waste basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been misguided by my emotional mind. If I thought about death, my emotional side kicked in and took over reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the people who will miss you. Think about your body decaying. Think about the future without you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as I got older, those worries lingered. Depression set and anxiety attacks appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar feelings arose when I received rejection letters from grad school, isolated myself from loved ones, and after nasty break-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;meditation-part-1&quot;&gt;Meditation, Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I tried meditation. I learned emotion can be examined and felt. My emotional side can overwhelm me, and I have fought the feeling head on. Instead, meditation says to examine the feeling and to let it happen. You achieve this through a non-judgment lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I witnessed the elephant the first few times I meditated. I approached meditation through a book I read. It stressed posture, breathing, and examination of the body. After the second week, my rational mind didn’t see the elephant. It imagined the daydream version of it. Unable to relax as I had with the previous week, I quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seneca&quot;&gt;Seneca&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied philosophical thought to the response of my elephant. Seneca, Roman philosopher from two millennia ago, taught his pupils to engage in a morning ritual of telling themselves what was the worst possible thing that could happen that day. Imagine it in detail, trying to put yourself in your own shoes. Imagine what you will be doing, how you’ll be feeling, etc. If the worst were to happen, you would be mentally prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise could be morbid, like imagining you or your significant other’s demise. This might be trivial, like getting angry at drivers who cut you off. Whichever end of the spectrum your imagination takes you, you are experiencing that feeling in a controlled dose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did this exercise a bunch at my last job. My manager pulled the rug from our projects a few too many times, and I kept feeling wrecked. In the parking lot before going in the building, I’d ask myself what’s the worst thing that could happen that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be fired. My project could be pulled. I could receive a demotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after a few days of this exercise, imagining what it would feel like to be first, I wasn’t scared of that prospect any more. And I took that insight and wrote my resignation letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;meditation-part-2&quot;&gt;Meditation, Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I revisited meditation last year when I got a guided meditation app. This was a lot more relaxing as I placed myself in the guide’s practice. I dedicated a chunk of time each morning to practice. If I couldn’t practice at home, I’d take the time on my train ride to work to do it. The app was more motivating, obtaining badges and tracking my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My practice was less examination of emotion than it was a stress reliever. The rider was able to spend more time working with the elephant, and the elephant sensed the rider was less stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long vacation, I stopped. I didn’t want to meditate around friends. When I came home, I dropped the practice. But now as I’m writing this, I may give it a 4th chance because I recognize the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rider holds the reins of the elephant, but the elephant overpowers the rider. When the rider is too stubborn to acknowledge the elephant, the elephant dictates the outcome. Many times, this is the voice of instant gratification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the rider can notice the elephant’s resistance, the rider’s best option is to roll with it. Now, ask yourself, how can I work with the elephant, and not against it? As the rider, we have the ability to plan ahead and take lessons learned from past failures. Now apply that to your everyday conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-reactive-problem&quot;&gt;The Reactive Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-reaction-dilemma&quot;&gt;The Reaction Dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a $400 mistake. I arrived at JFK 6:30 in the morning ready to go home. I punched in my confirmation code in the kiosk, but my ticket wouldn’t print. I pulled up the itinerary email. The flight was marked with tomorrow’s date. I made the mistake of buying the wrong ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked the ticketing agent if I could grab an earlier flight. She told me it would cost an extra $400 with charges and fees for a flight that left in a few hours. To add salt to the wound, only middle seats were available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My body said to stay put, but my mind said to go home. I bit the bullet and paid the extra amount. A few moments later, I regretted my decision. But I went through with it, and I cursed myself because it was the worst decision I made all year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was four years ago. Today, I wonder what prompted me to make such a mistake. Everything that ticket agent said was rational, yet my thoughts were caught in a sea of emotions. I was afraid I wasn’t going to make it to work the next day. In reality, I would have made it to work on time given there were no flight delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reacting to my situation without thinking about the long-term consequences. This feeling goes by many names, like fire-fighting, and if you are surrounded by this behavior, you are likely to adopt this frantic role. The behavior is anchored by the perception of time. “There’s not enough time to think” could be the slogan. And in this slip of time, I’m out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;busy-mind&quot;&gt;Busy Mind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I remember watching “The Price is Right”. Each contestant on the game show must make decisions within a short time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many can’t think straight with the flashing lights, the potential prizes they could have, and the emotional burst of being on television. They look out to the crowd and try to take the advice of other audience members, likely the ones they came with, in hopes their shouting could be the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This environment promotes a chaotic mind. How can you think straight with the noise? The show’s producers know this and tell the game developers to use common price biases to throw the contestant off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, there’s a game where the contestant has four items to determine if the item is higher or lower than the tagged price. You can bet the game developers take advantage of anchoring, a bias where the contestant will be affected by the first price they see. When the contestant plays this game, the short decision window clouds their judgment, and that’s susceptible to anchoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online shopping is a similar experience. I have many temptations to buy things I don’t need because of the convenient factor. For this reason, I’ve turned off one-click shopping on Amazon as a safe guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My weakness is making decisions around limited time deals, like flash sales, items at the checkout line, and Black Friday. If you’ve read my newsletter on catalogs, my seeds catalog was an instant buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recurring solution I’ve found to all of these decisions is to bench the decision for a certain amount of time. For instant shopping, it’s 24 hours. For the flight change, it’s ten minutes. This time period is reserved for calming time — to get rid of extra baggage and emotion when making my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll explore more next week on anger and the calming down effect.&lt;/p&gt;
