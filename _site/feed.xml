&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Jear Bear Letter’s penultimate letter of the series “Seven Degrees of Strangers”. If you’ve just started reading this series, I interview a stranger one degree of separation at a time. And you should check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craftbyzen.com/letters/season-three/&quot;&gt;old letters from this series on my website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I’m presenting a conversation I had with Raina Evans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-raina-evans&quot;&gt;Enter Raina Evans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!-- These are notes --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished having lunch at Black Bear Diner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July training days - online training&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie - ex-husbnad (Jonathan) - worked aat the same youth organization in the mid to late 90s. Friends through work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their eldest son is the same age as Raina’s daughter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raina left that organization, worked at a couple different organization until she worked on the board of the Portland Housing Center. The organization helps home owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She started managing education classes to help rental housing. Organizaion wanted Raina to fill the role. Less candidates with social services, more to program management and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portland Housing Center - ready to rent, the board really liked it. They asked Raina three times before she agreed to lead the class. She gave it a year, which turned to 3 years. At the end fo the 3rd year, the board decided to stop the program. PHC’s director told Raina she should run it on her own. This was around the time she just got married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006, blended family. Took cirriculum to teach other teachers. Cirriculum took two years for the staff and writers to put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Licensed the cirriculum to other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2007 - possession of cirriculum of “Ready to Rent”
2010 - gave copyright to Raina’s org&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaway-message&quot;&gt;Takeaway message&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get this text from Mary two weeks after our interview that says “you need to connect with her. I just told her about you.” There was a VCard attached, but my phone couldn’t tell how to parse it. I had to take the raw VCard text, convert it on my computer, then add it to my contacts online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike all of the strangers before, I can’t tell you the connection between Mary and Julie. So who is she?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-julie-valenti&quot;&gt;Enter Julie Valenti&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie runs the Wellness center in Portland, Or. When I spoke to her, she had just moved to San Diego, Ca. She spends some time every two weeks up in Portland to help with logistics for the center, then takes clients remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of going over Julie’s background, I decided to devote my time with her to talk about empty nest syndrome, learning about her book, and the writing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;childhood-ptsd&quot;&gt;Childhood PTSD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie grew up in Idaho with an alcoholic father and a ?? mother. When she went to college, she studied psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;therapy-and-the-20-concepts&quot;&gt;Therapy and the 20 Concepts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some therapies can be prolonged for decades. Patients come back, lie on the couch, and talk out their issues to their therapist. Rinse and repeat for years to decades, and it feel like all the therapist is there for is someone who will listen, for a hefty sum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Julie’s program is different. She relates all of our mental problems with neuropsychology and hormone imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had absolutely no background on Mary Alpoliani when I asked her to be my next interviewee. Joe was taking longer than I expected to get back to me, but when he did, he didn’t disappoint. I called Mary a few days before our interview to schedule the meeting, and immediately, I knew I was going to enjoy our conversation. If you’ve read Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Mary’s a prime example of a super-connector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-mary-alpoliani&quot;&gt;Enter Mary Alpoliani&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary came from humble beginings in Indiana. She grew up on a farm and her food was her family’s language. She graduated from ?? and her husband and her worked all over. They’ve been traveling around all over the US, selling and managing food products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was talking with Mary, she was driving her daughter to an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-game&quot;&gt;The Game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of this traveling Mary does, she spends a lot of time eating on her own. She doesn’t eat alone though. She told me about this game she plays when she’s at a restaurant with a bar. She scouts the bar area to see if there are any patrons eating alone. If there is, she’ll sit near them. Once the waiter has given he a menu, she looks over to her neighbor’s plate and ask him or her, “Oh, that looks good. What are you eating?”. Mary’s never had a time where the patron has not answered her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the real game has started. After striking this conversation, Mary’s intent is to see if she can get her patron to offer her a sample from their plate. To Mary’s recollection, every patron has given her food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked if she got to get her daughter to do that. Her daughter spoke up and said she’s done it once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;managing-connections&quot;&gt;Managing Connections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaway-message&quot;&gt;Takeaway message&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stop looking at your glass, get off your ass”. Her daughter was listening to the conversation, and told me she couldn’t say that last word. Which was very cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Jear Bear Letter’s third letter of the series “Seven Degrees of Strangers”. If you’ve just started reading this series, I interview a stranger one degree of separation at a time. This week, I’m presenting a conversation I had with Joe Lazarra. He runs a butcher shop and fish market in Carmel, Indiana. He also happens to be the previous interviewee, Evan, father’s best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe has walked an unconventional path. We dive into his past work, his butcher shop, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-joe-lazzara&quot;&gt;Enter Joe Lazzara&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t expecting Joe to be a masterful storyteller. If you ever talk to him, he has a very solid sense of self. He started his story by transporting me back over a century ago. His great grandparents grew up in Sicily. Because the number of times Sicilians have been conquered, other Italians call them outsiders. Sicilians have a different dialect and different culture. They value family, culture and food. Especially food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe’s grandparents and their brothers sold produce in California and southern Indiana. Joe prefaced their lives and business were riddled with stories of escapades, murders, and running from the KKK. If I ever get to hang out with Joe, I’d love him to tell me some of them. What’s important to Joe is the Sicilian heritage followed them to America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe’s mother learned recipes passed down from the older generation. Joe’s aunt taught his mother how to cook, handing them generation to generation. Needless to say, the family bonds over food, like Joe helping make the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe is youngest of 6 children. There’s an 18 year generational gap between his oldest brother and himself. Because of that, his father, his eldest brother, and he are born in different generations. His father was born in the 20s, his brother in the 40s, and Joe in the 60s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe’s father didn’t make much money. Yet, he valued education and funded all 6 children through college. He knew that going to college is important. He didn’t have a large house. He made sure none of his children never paid a dime. Joe’s very fortunate and greatful to his father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;college-and-early-career&quot;&gt;College and Early Career&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In college, Joe met Charlie Roar, Evan’s dad. They became dependable friends and fraternity brothers. Today, they remain close. Joe is a godfather to Charlie’s daughter. Joe’s a part of Charlie’s family as they moved from Chicago to Minnesota to North Carolina. When Joe’s father passed away, you can bet Charlie was there for him and his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe studied Quantatative analysis, which during the mid to late
80’s, was the thing to study and get a great job. When Joe graduated, he worked at Indiana Bell. Joe started working ona software project that everntually got sold to General Telephone and Electric, GTE. However, Indiana Bell didn’t want to help with maintaining the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GTE needed consultants, and Joe along with some other saw this as an opportunity to create their own consulting company, called United Informations Technology. Joe was 23 at the time and moved with the company to Tampa Bay. On weekends he’d invite friends. The job demanded Joe travel all over. With the sales commissions, Joe was making 6 figures. But the company’s success didn’t last long. The company hired an HR manager to manage pensions as they started growing. They hired someone who, unbeknownst to the rest of the company, took those pensions and bought coke in Florida and sold it in Chicago. One day, the FBI and DEA knock on Joe’s door asking about the illegal activity. Joe exits as soon as he can; the company gets dissolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe took a position with GTE in Indianapolis selling cellular to wireless carriers. Because of where the market was heading with cellular networks, selling was like shooting fish in a barrel. Year over year, Joe was the top 1% of sales people. He rose the ranks and became a general manager over other sales people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this period, he got married and has kids. He’s in his early 30’s, and he’s traveling all over the U.S. for his sales job. He got tired of going out to the bars with his guy friends. Instead, he uses this time to explore restaurants, especially those who have gone on to be awarded Michelin stars or become James Beard candidates. Those are prestigious accolades in the food world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in New Orleans, Nellie Brennan of Brennan’s restaurant takes Charlie’s cousin and Joe to the Commander’s Palace to meet Emeril Lagasse before Emeril opened his flagship restaurant and well before he was a Food network celebrity. Joe meets Susan Spicer before she became big at the Bistro at Maison de Ville. Other restaurants thought Joe was a food critic and would invite him at the Chef’s table if he called. When they found out he was only a food enthusiast, they laughed and cooked up a storm. His food and wine palette expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GTE gets bought out by Bell Atlantic and forms Verizon. Joe becomes in charge of the telecomm act where he has to negotitate contracts on behalf of Verizon. He has to travel even more. In 1999, Joe quits to join a telecomm start-up in Indiana, First Mile Technology. The company was ahead of other ISPs offering 100 MB ethernet where other companies were offering at most T1 speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business was going well. Then 9/11 happened. VC capital dried up. Joe had a tough time getting developers to give the start-up capital upfront because they didn’t have the money. Joe left and consulted for a bunch of small companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, he consulted for a few years. But Joe grew tired on traveling
around. Clients were asking Joe to do things that were against his principles, like move phone numbers around, move money around, and lose trails. He sought solice from his brothers and Charlie. They reminded him of wanting to start a restaurant or be in food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;butchershop&quot;&gt;Butchershop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carmel, Indiana is a progressive city and their mayor wanted to build a city center. The mayor asked Joe if he wanted to start a restuarant there. When Joe asked his wife, she objected. She told him they have three children, ages 3, 5, and 7, and he wouldn’t be there for them at night. Joe remembered his friend, Mark Zannoni. He was also Italian, and Mark’s father owned a butcher shop outside of Chicago. Joe asked his wife about a buthcer shop, and she agreed that would be a better choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They put about a year of work into opening the shop before it opened. The first year’s return was at a loss, but since then, they’ve been on the up. They’re netting a few million a year, and it has become such an integral piece to the community. Joe’s been at it for 11 years. You can find the butcher shop and fish market’s website at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an old couple that used to shop at Joe’s butchershop weekly. They loved talking to Joe and the staff. One week, Joe noticed the husband stopped coming. The next Saturday, she comes in early just after the opening hour and walks through the door dressed top-to-bottom with a red dress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe asked the lady where her husband. The lady leans over the counter and tells Joe her husband passed away. Joe tells her he’s sorry to hear, but the lady stops him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I came here to tell you. We loved interacting with you and the staff. Coming here for the past 5 years made him happy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Joe’s ready to melt after this. It’s situations like this that has taught him he’s the caretaker of community trust. He’s seen customers have babies who have now grown to become pre-teens. He caters to community member’s funerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe tells me it’s not about the money. It’s all about giving back to the people. It’s the satisfaction knowing you’re delivering the turkey to your customer’s home during Thanksgiving. Early on, Joe wanted to franchise the business and build many “Joe’s Butchershops”. Now, Joe wants to make his shop iconic, like Ann Arbor’s Zimmerman’s Deli, or San Francisco’s Gheridelli’s Square. Carmel is an up and coming, affluent city, about an hour or two away from Indianapolis. People from all over the state come to visit the butcher shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe picked the right location, and he owes his success to his background in sales. Without it, he couldn’t see a different side of business. One where the customer gives you feedback and where you listen. Joe’s mission is to share good karma, because things come back. And he can’t see himself doing anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I sleep at night. I sleep like a baby, for the most part. Wheras before, I was always concerned about the next sale, or how I was going to get that revenue stream.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe’s takeaway makes a wonderful quote. “Love unconditionally, and you will be returned with unconditional joy.” Very humbling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I talked to Simon Gonedeck, a young Web Developer and Entrepreneur. This week, I’m talking to Evan Roer, Simon’s friend. This is the second installment of my series about connectedness. If you missed the newsletter last week, this series is a set of interviews where I interview a stranger one degree of separation at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-evan&quot;&gt;Enter Evan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I wanted to know about Evan was how did he know Simon? As Evan recalls, he’s known Simon and Sevy, Simon’s twin brother, for as long as he can remember. Growing up, Evan’s and Simon’s families were part of the same gourmet club. Evan’s older brother is roommates with Simon’s older brother. Evan’s family moved to North Carolina when Evan was in third grade, yet the families kept in touch. If Evan’s traveling to Minneapolis, which happens once or twice a year, he’s staying with Simon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan resides in Raleigh, North Carolina. He works for Design Dimension, a design firm specializing in exhibit design for museums. He started this job a year ago and has an unconventional story on how he got there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;landing-the-job&quot;&gt;Landing the Job&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan was a brand ambassador at North Carolina State University (NC State) for the university’s recreation center. That means Evan would prepare the recreation center with school events. The school designates brand ambassadors 13 office hours to do prep work. But as Evan learned, it doesn’t take that long to setup tables and handout merchandise. With all of this idle time, he noticed peers making posters in the gym promoting upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan wasn’t studying graphic design. He was studying business marketing. He wanted to follow a creative itch and make posters. As Evan puts it, he got to see graphic design in the works, and with his boss’ permission, he would create posters, take the time to use the school’s Lynda.com tutorials to learn graphic design software, and develop a portfolio. By the end of Evan’s college career, he had an extensive portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After graduating, when it was time to find a job, Evan applied to both design studios and businesses seeking his skills in Business Marketing. One of those design firms he submitted his portfolio to was Design Dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan got an internship with an tech firm and had started working for a week or two before Design Dimension called him. He thought it would be worth a shot at the interview since his current role may not hire him full-time. And it was very convenient since his internship was five buildings away from the Design Dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan was the only candidate without a design degree. He meshed well with the firm’s lead designer, Betsy, his future boss. She liked Evan’s portfolio, and even more, his tastes and preferences in beer and music. And it helped they both went to the same school where Evan’s fraternity had close ties to Betsy’s sorority. Betsy likes to blast music in the design studio, and because whoever she had to work with would have to be tolerant of that. The candidate had to mesh well with her. And Evan sure did, so he was hired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-dimension&quot;&gt;Design Dimension&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one thing I wanted to takeaway from Evan: What does it mean to be a professional designer at Design Dimension? From Evan’s perspective, it sounds like a lot of work. He could be juggling many clients at once. “People don’t like to read long paragraphs”, he tells me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Evan could be working for a Botanical Garden. The job could be to layout a design for explaining photosynthesis. Evan’s work is to take the given space and design the entire experience. For the botanical garden, Evan knows the exhibitors don’t want to read a barrage of words when they can see pictures. I thought back to my recent trip to the American Museum of Natural History in New York. They had a forrest canopy exhibit where there was some text to accompany the massive forrest installation, but it didn’t stop me from admiring the size of the trees with all of its intricate details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restraint&quot;&gt;Restraint&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a designer means knowing when to restrain. For example, if Evan’s doing work for a Town Hall, the Opera House in Sumter, NC, or a small companies, he will try to push their brand. But if he’s working for an established corporation like IBM, or the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, he’ll stick within the boundaries of their existing brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restraint also comes to play with dealing with clients. Evan may have clients where his clients want to be the graphic designer as well. The feedback they give sound more like barking orders. If he finds himself arguing with a client, and the client is wrong, he has to find a way to come to a compromise. “And that’s what pushes you as a designer”, he tells me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;clients&quot;&gt;Clients&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the clients come with the content. It’s Design Dimension’s job to make it presentable. And the clients are super involved from start to finish. When Evan was working for a “Black History of Wilson” exhibit in Wilson, North Carolina, the clients wanted to pack as much information as possible. However, it doesn’t tell a story. Clearly the client is wrong, and it’s Evan’s job to convince them to change their content by selling them on the design idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work can be rewarding. Evan worked on a children’s museum in Wilson that taught science. The museum was outdated, a relic from the 80s. The museum’s administrator secured the funds to update and upgrade the space. and Evan’s team worked with the administrator closely to come to a good design. When it was all said and done, the space was resurrected, brought back to life with updated science. And for the administrator, her reaction was priceless because she put her heart and soul in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s only recently Evan’s had interactions with the client. Following off of the conversation I had with Simon last week, I wanted to know how Evan deals with feedback and criticism. Evan tells me it pushes you to be better. You have to be able to speak the same language, and rarely does one design iteration is sufficient. As a great designer, you have to be able to let things go. Even if Evan thinks one of his logos looks damn amazing, the client could reject it and have the whole process start over. Evan’s learned to let that go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan’s takeaway for you is to make connections in life. Everything’s connected in relationship to each other. And to find those and be able to point those out is a really fun thing to do. Put yourself out there. Make connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;random-tidbits&quot;&gt;Random Tidbits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Out of our interview, I hired Evan to do the letterhead and accompanying illustrations for each piece&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evan loves discovering music, new and old. His favorite music festival is Bonnaroo in Tennessee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evan’s favorite font: &lt;a href=&quot;https://typekit.com/fonts/din-condensed&quot;&gt;Din Condensed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the next installment of the Jear-Bear Letters. After a brief four
month hiatus, we’re back with a new series called Seven Degrees of Strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next 7 weeks, I will write about the conversation I
had with 7 people, each one degree of separation away. You’ll get to hear
their stories and experiences, and how I relate to them. At the end of each
interview, I will ask the participant to choose the next person for me to
interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title is a play on “Seven Degrees of Separation” where you are at most
seven links away from knowing any random stranger on Earth. So if I met a
stranger on the street, I could trace them to at most seven degrees of
separation until I found a connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-are-you-doing-this-project&quot;&gt;Why are you doing this project?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with a thought about connections. On LinkedIn, you can see
potential new friends who are second or third degrees of separation. I
wondered, who are these people? How does everyone know each other? If I
continue down the path of separations, could I meet someone famous?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in May, while I was conceiving the idea for this series, I went to a talk
with Bill Burnnett and Dave Evans. They are professors at Stanford who wrote a
book called “Designing Your Life”. In their talk, they asked everyone to turn
to their side, speak with their neighbor, and ask them something you need help
with. I turned to my neighbor, we introduced ourselves, and I asked about a
question about appropriative technologies. She didn’t have any tips, but she
knew someone who could direct me to who might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pondered about the interaction for a week. It’s not an everyday feeling for
me to ask for help from strangers. Even though the woman didn’t know someone
directly, she knew of someone who could get me closer to my answer. This
project is my exercise to practice that power of connectedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the series, we’ll find out what connectedness means to other
people. And build a new connection by the end of our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-first-degree-of-separation&quot;&gt;The First Degree of Separation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin this series, I reached out to my friend, Simon Gonedeck. He’s an
entrepreneur and web developer for his own consulting company,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mgwebpartners.com/&quot;&gt;MG Web Partners&lt;/a&gt;. Besides catching up with an
friend, I wanted to probe him about starting a company. Simon did not disappoint. In our conversation, he went over that and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-simon&quot;&gt;Enter Simon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon’s a recent grad from the University of St. Thomas with a B.S. in
accounting. I met Simon three years ago at a software bootcamp. I got Simon to
join my team for the final project where we built a social network for
upcoming Memorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We paired programmed a few times and hung out outside of the program. I got
Simon to join our final team project where we created a social network for
grieving. Simon was a total team player and whooped my ass into gear when we
took a break at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon’s a lacrosse player, and what I consider a total athlete. Unfortunately,
at the time we were talking, he was recorvering from an injury when we had the
interview. I realize that he’s a person to go to for my atheletic questions,
so in the future, I’ll be reaching out to him more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jermspeaks/jermspeaks.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/7_DOS_Simon_Graphic.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Simon wearing letterman with head as computer screen&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mg-web-partners&quot;&gt;MG Web Partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the software bootcamp, Simon went back to school, living in St. Paul,
Minnesota. He was working at a web consulting company where he would be
compensated far less than the contract stipulated. An epiphany came when he
was at a yoga class. The studio were in need of a website, but all of the
contractors they found were out of their budget. Simon and his friend Johnny
and he drafted a reasonable offer, and they got their first contract.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mgwebpartners.com/&quot;&gt;MG Web Partners&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-on-starting-a-business&quot;&gt;Lessons on Starting a Business&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before their first contract, Simon and Johnny had little to no knowledge on
how to draft one. They looked online to figure out what a contract should say.
And contracts weren’t the only thing they had to figure out for the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon brought on his twin brother, Sevy, to help out with growing the
business. One of their challenges the team faced was to find more customers.
They drove around the area, going business to business to attract more
customers. They sent out an email campaign last June, seen below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My partners Johnny Mulvahill, Sevy Gondeck and I have started a web design
and development company called MG Web Partners.
We specialize in building businesses remarkable websites that deliver new
customers and drive revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We help three kinds of companies:
 1. Companies with outdated websites
 2. Companies with poorly designed websites
 3. Or Companies that just need a new website&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Most companies fit one of these three scenarios, so if you know of anyone,
please forward them my contact information and I promise we’ll take good
care of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon was hesitant to use email marketing and social media because he viewed
it as mass spam. He didn’t want disinterested people to see his work, and
worse, find he was bombarding friends and family with unnecessary mail. Sevy
convinced Simon to reach out and not worry about that. What you write will
have no interest to some people, and a lot of interest to a few people. You
never know who those people are until you cast a wide net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to Simon talk about his business reminded me how much we learn on the job. When we talked about the details of drafting proposals, Simon talked about the mistakes he previously made. For example, it’s better to draw up a proposal that’s less stringent and allows for flexibility with the client. And it’s better to make the process transparent, so the company uses
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.proposify.biz/&quot;&gt;Proposify&lt;/a&gt;, a website that allows clients to review proposals while also giving the business insight into how their clients are reviewing their proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reflection, Simon says the best strategy that attracted the most customers was “Word of Mouth”. In the business of contracting, referrals matter more. Having previous clients tell potential future clients of their work has been more substantial than other techniques. And with every new client, the business learns they learned something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while we’re on clients, how do you communicate with them? Simon has found the best way is to make a phone call or face-to-face. Texting and email interactions are easy to evade and do not convey the same tone as his voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the customer signs off on the proposal and agrees to the timeline, the team gets to work on the project. After the first design iteration or prototype, the team shares it with the customer to review. The team has learned that it reduces the amount of time on wasted work if there’s less guesswork on details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team has worked with clients all over the area. All of the team members have graduated college. Sevy will be leaving the company later this summer to join Deloitte. Simon still plans to growing this company, and getting the forumla right before bringing more people on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;questions-for-me&quot;&gt;Questions for me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our conversation about MG Web Partners, Simon turned the tables and asked me a few questions. The benefit of being a first connection is they already know something about you. And in Simon’s case, he’s a long time reader of the Jear-Bear letters, so he had some questions around writing and growing an online prescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-writing&quot;&gt;On Writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon asked some advice about creating a writing habit and how to get through
writer’s block. One of his goals is to boost
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mgwebpartners.com/blog/&quot;&gt;his company’s blog&lt;/a&gt; by writing more
frequently. I had a few recommendations for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read “Bird by Bird” by Anne Lammont, or at least the chapter on “Shitty
First Drafts”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise of this chapter is you’re not going to write the best you can on the first draft. After hearing that, I felt more free to write. It taught me I can give myself permission towrite freely without having to worry about making the best piece of writing from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also, there is much more work in editing than I thought. After a year of writing, I spent more of my time crafting the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take inspiration from &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin’s Blog&lt;/a&gt; because he updates it every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’re talking about prolific, it doesn’t get as good as Seth Godin’s blog,
which he has been serving for over the past decade. He’s the prime example of
less is more, which has helped me in editing down my own writing much less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;other-pointers&quot;&gt;Other pointers&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t expect success.&lt;/strong&gt; As counter-intuitive as it may be, that piece of advice helped me release what I consider terrible writing to my letter friends. A few of those letters have been very well received, like my “Caltrain Suicides” letter and my “Lost Keys” letter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing is just as important as writing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find peers to review your writing.&lt;/strong&gt; Earlier on in my letter writing, I decided to open up each letter for critique.
I reached out on Twitter to see who could be my critique, and a few people
helped me &lt;a href=&quot;#shout-out&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;. I’d send a draft out, and they would give me some helpful criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember Helin gave me some pointers about sub-headers, which I didn’t
initially like, but has grown on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I stopped because my critiques wouldn’t come back before my
deadline, so I carried along hoping my audience would tell me. Turns out, they
don’t, so this project is to help me out further because I’m working alongside
an illustrator. While the illustrator’s primary job is not to be a critic, it
does help to have a second eye. Plus, if I’m really stuck on something, I’ll
drag a friend into it. Stephen King wrote in “On Writing” that his wife reads
through his novels before he releases them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;shout-out&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;Shout outs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/helin_s&quot;&gt;Helin&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/j12coder&quot;&gt;Isaac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-aways&quot;&gt;Take-aways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Simon what’s one thing he wants people to take away with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over-communicate with clients. It might not always be clear what they want.
Don’t do it over email. Do it over the phone or in-person, if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/&quot;&gt;a lengthy comic&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://code-cartoons.com/&quot;&gt;Lin Clark&lt;/a&gt; about WebAssembly,
I thought it might be great to do a deep dive with it.
Thank goodness the folks behind the project have a very nice &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To compile to WebAssembly, we will at the moment need to compile LLVM from source. The following tools are needed as a prerequisite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m on OSX. Check the link for above for your prerequisites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Git&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CMake&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Xcode&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Python (2.7.x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;compile-emscripten-from-source&quot;&gt;Compile Emscripten from Source&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Building Emscripten from source is automated via the Emscripten SDK. The required steps are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git clone https://github.com/juj/emsdk.git
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;emsdk
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./emsdk install sdk-incoming-64bit binaryen-master-64bit
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./emsdk activate sdk-incoming-64bit binaryen-master-64bit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After these steps, the installation is complete. To enter an Emscripten compiler environment in the current command line prompt, type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ./emsdk_env.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This command adds relevant environment variables and directory entries to PATH to set up the current terminal for easy access to the compiler tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, the installation process will take a while. Go make yourself some tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;To conveniently access the selected &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set &lt;/span&gt;of tools from the &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;command &lt;/span&gt;line,  
consider adding the following directories to PATH, or call &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'source  
./emsdk_env.sh'&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do &lt;/span&gt;this &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;you.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compile-and-run-a-simple-program&quot;&gt;Compile and run a simple program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We now have a full toolchain we can use to compile a simple program to WebAssembly. There are a few remaining caveats, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have to pass the linker flag &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-s WASM=1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;emcc&lt;/code&gt; (otherwise by default emcc will emit asm.js).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If we want Emscripten to generate an HTML page that runs our program, in addition to the wasm binary and JavaScript wrapper, we have to specify an output filename with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Finally, to actually run the program, we cannot simply open the HTML file in a web browser because cross-origin requests are not supported for the file protocol scheme. We have to actually serve the output files over HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The commands below will create a simple “hello world” program and compile it. The compilation step is highlighted in bold.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;mkdir hello
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;hello
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; hello.c
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'int main(int argc, char ** argv) {'&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; hello.c
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'printf(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);'&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; hello.c
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'}'&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; hello.c
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;emcc hello.c -s &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;WASM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1 -o hello.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To serve the compiled files over HTTP, we can use the emrun web server provided with the Emscripten SDK:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;emrun --no_browser --port 8080 .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once the HTTP server is running, you can open it in your browser. If you see “Hello, world!” printed to the Emscripten console, then congratulations! You’ve successfully compiled to WebAssembly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how my logs looked when running the program&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;➜  hello-wasm emcc hello.c -s &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;WASM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1 -o hello.html

  &lt;p&gt;“Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” — Ferris Bueller’s Day Off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thought crossed my mind. “Am I rushing to die?” I had this thought before. I used to brush it off. The Ferris Bueller quote encapsulates the essence of life, to open up to live. “Am I missing life?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I have an urge to rush to the end. But I risk not thinking through consequences. Rushing through my day, I jump into solutions without thinking about other options and alternative outcomes. When coding, it’s jumping into a solution without thinking about intentions. The implementation could have an immediate problem within the technical details. Or it can have an ethical one. For example, if we have a selection input for gender, you may assume the world operates on a gender binary. That is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To rush is to deny room to be aware. And thats a decision. It’s my decision if I treat work like race to exhaustion. It’s my decision to rush out of the door every morning, without checking if I have my essentials, to catch the early train. It’s my decision if I prolong getting my eyes checked. It’s my decision to stop working out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These scenarios lead to stress. Our bodies give us indication of stress. I have made myself numb to some of it. When the neglect goes too far, the body prevents us from moving forward. I’ve been close to passing out the last time I pulled an all nighter at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks of writing about failures is a reflection of what I’ve neglected in my life and why I stopped paying attention. These letters are to kick myself in the ass and ask, “what I’m going to do about this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say the solution is as simple as slowing down; be present. This is my invocation to begin. I’m standing firm not to neglect the mind and body’s needs. I will let that guide my present intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope is for my future self to read this. My hope is my future self has slowed down. And if he has, please follow up and tell everyone how you did it. And say Bueller was right.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="letters" /><category term="season_2" /><category term="letters" /><summary></summary></entry><entry><title>The Placement Problem</title><link href="localhost:4000/letters/season-two/the-placement-problem.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Placement Problem" /><published>2017-04-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-04-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>localhost:4000/letters/season-two/the-placement-problem</id><content type="html" xml:base="localhost:4000/letters/season-two/the-placement-problem.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/b7acb1dd09358f1ed19f16a562a005fc08d42511/images/f60b85ea-98ea-469f-9942-d15b84fd12f7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jear bear letters admission failure 7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-placement-problem&quot;&gt;The Placement Problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lost-keys&quot;&gt;Lost Keys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the frantic rush of the morning, I’m scrambling many things. I’ve got to shower, eat breakfast, work-out, gather my things for work. In this scramble I inevitably ask myself, “where are my keys?”. If I was wise, they would be in my bag. If I was unwise, I start my descent into madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my key’s perspective, it’s a journey through my room. First, they’ll be in my pocket, ready to open a door. Then they will be on my work table, eager to see me when I’m ready to leave. Then they’ll be on top of the drawer because I’m changing my pants. Then they’ll be god knows where because I was in the middle of another activity and decided to place them wherever was convenient. Then I’ll spend an inextricable amount of time looking for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s times like these I feel helpless to my lack of coordination. I hate my forgetfulness because I lack the foresight to place things in proper places. My keys have a place in my bag, and should always be there. And for the scenario where I don’t bring my bag, it should be in my pocket. But therein lies the problem. If I know I won’t bring my bag, where do I place my keys when I change my pants?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-system&quot;&gt;A System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was working in manufacturing, we implemented a 5 step program to achieving lean manufacturing. One of those steps was setting things in place. In one scenario, say you use a hammer. You take the hammer from its proper placement, use it for a bit, then place it back. To make things easier, one of our technicians placed an outline of a hammer so it is easy to place the hammer in its proper place. The alternative is placing the hammer wherever, which would be harder for the next person who wants to use the hammer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this practice, I should be able to implement it in my personal life. However, I am rarely open to the idea of changing my space. This is prompted by a stubborn attitude that I should remember everything. Added to that, I find moving things around my room to be a chore. And it’s all over when I consider something to be a chore because I’ll try to wiggle out of it any way I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;applied-system&quot;&gt;Applied System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to they keys. Because I lack a system to place my keys in the same place for every scenario, I find it difficult to find them when I’ve placed them in a spot at the time I thought was memorable. I’ve thought about a cubby, or a bowl, but haven’t acted on it. I’m skeptic it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question for those readers. Do you follow a system for placing your things at home. How do you remember where you put your things? Does your system cover all scenarios?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;addendum&quot;&gt;Addendum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest. After drafting this letter, I’m going to give the bowl a try. At least I can cross it off my list if it really doesn’t work. Then it’s back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="letters" /><category term="season_2" /><category term="letters" /><summary></summary></entry></feed>
