<p>Start with a beginner’s mind. A beginner’s mind is open to new and radical ideas
An expert’s mind rejects new ideas and sticks to what they know.
When I quit my job as a medical device engineer and decided to become a web developer, I was afraid of what I was getting myself into
But then I remembered this zen concept, “beginner’s mind”, and it reminded me that hacking and tinkering away at a programming language can be fun with infinite possibilities</p>

<p>Through breaking and creating things as a kid, I knew I had the maker spirit inside
I decided to go through the Dev Bootcamp program and found myself making again; the coolest thing is to imagine something on Monday,
and stare at its physical manifestation by Friday. That feeling along with the feelings of frustration, disappointment and sacrifice that comes along with the journey,
is something I am falling in love with</p>

<p>But I haven’t done it alone. Being talented or an expert at something isn’t mutually exclusive to being a great co-worker.
I’ve found out through teamwork and management that communication trumps talent.
The ability to communicate and working well with others that matters more, and I have been working on it during the past few months while being team lead on my projects.
I learned a kind person, different than a nice person, can tell others they are doing a great job or they need to work on something without sugar coating it</p>
