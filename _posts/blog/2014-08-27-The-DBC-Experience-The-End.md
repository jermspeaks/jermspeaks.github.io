# THE DBC EXPERIENCE: THE END

I've reached the end of my DBC experience and am currently going through career week right now. I'm glad, and yet sad, my nine week experience here in Chicago DBC is over.

It's still a bit too early to see the outcome of this program on me, which may take months, and even past my first job. But here are some takeaways I learned about myself while doing this program.

- I really enjoy leading a team
- There's always lots to learn on the "soft skills"
- Taking feedback isn't easy work, but that doesn't mean you should ignore it. Embrace it and act rationally.
- It's perfectly fine to cry in a room of adults, even if you're the only one doing it.
- As adults, we forget all too often that we really try hard to hide embarrassment in front of others. Stop worrying about that. If they talk about you, what's the worst that could happen?

I'm by far not the first person to blog about my experiences at DBC, and I can not do it justice in one blog posts. As I learn more about myself and what has really been the most telling things that I should have been working on all along, I'll share it.

Until then, Goodbye.
