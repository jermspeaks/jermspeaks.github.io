# Life after Deactivation

I’ve deactivated my Facebook Account indefinitely. If someone wants to be a Facebook friend of mine, I’ll gladly be, if you tell me beforehand so I can reactivate it. Deactivation is a quick cheat that doesn’t apparently work well though. I’ve recently made a new splash page using [about.me](https://about.me/jeremywong). I attached my deactivated Facebook account and still, my status updates still were up there, albeit I never really update it.

A little background first. I was on Facebook with the privacy settings jacked up to being as private as possible. Over the past two years, I’ve been lenient about a few things, but after the whole scare earlier this year when Facebook made more information private, or at least new accounts were being put as public profiles, I’ve became more untrusting of Facebook.
Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t the straw that broke the camel’s back. This is more of a safety measure of mine. I don’t believe too much in the fact that if you’ve done nothing wrong, you’ve got nothing to hide. It’s that I still have some dignity in my life, and if I want to own my life, I must claim it, not how Facebook can sell it.

Also: I might as well use Tumblr also as a writing journal or some sort from now on. I’ve been posting random things lately, and it’s just not fulfilling as a writer.
