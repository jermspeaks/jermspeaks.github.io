# Book Review: My Stroke of Insight

![My Stroke of Insight book cover](http://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4d0yvu1G71qz81kho1_400.jpg)

The book I’ve read last week was Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor’s “My Stroke of Insight”. Here is the [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight) she gave about her experience, and the book expands upon that. It’s split up on the story of her stroke, recovery, and next steps. It debunks common myths around strokes, and it gave me a better understanding about my own mind.
