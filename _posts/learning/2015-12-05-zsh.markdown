## Oh My Zsh

[Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is an extension of zsh that allows for extensibility on top of Zsh, such as autocompletion, [themes](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes), and plugins.

# Build Podcast Write-up

[Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is a community driven project for managing zsh configuration. We will explore some functions of [z-shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) (zsh), [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) and Oh My ZSH so that we can get to be a little more productive in our daily coding hours!

## Things to learn with Oh My ZSH

#### 1. iTerm

- `ctrl + cmd + t` to hide and show terminal
  - **tabs**:
    - new tab: `cmd + t`
    - toggle through tabs: `shift + cmd + [` or `shift + cmd + ]`
  - **panes**:
    - new pane: `shift + opt + cmd + v` for vertical or `shift + opt + cmd + h` for horizontal pane
    - toggle through panes: `cmd + [` or `cmd + ]`
    - switch pane with mouse: Preference > Pointer > Miscellaneous Setting > Focus follows Mouse
  - search with `cmd + f` and `opt + enter` to copy to clipboard
  - automcomplete for commands in history with `cmd + ;`

#### 2. zsh

1. change to zsh in iTerm: Preference > Profiles > General > Command > choose Command > `/bin/zsh`
1. `ps -ef|grep $$|grep -v grep` will look for current process ID in the list of current running processes - zsh in this case
1. spelling check
1. globbping - selecting files marching a pattern. E.g. to read all the `readme.md` files in the [build podcast repo](https://github.com/sayanee/Build-Podcast): `ls ~/Sites/build-podcast/**/*.md`
