# What the glob?

I ran across the [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) and realized I didn't know what a glob is. I read through the node-glob documentation and found out globs are a form of pattern matching. I realized I had been using globs for a long time, like the wildcard notation, without knowing its name.

## Wildcards

There are generally two wildcards you can use for glob functions.

1. `*` - "any string of characters"
1. `?` - one character

There are also brackets, where the character must be one of the following, or given as a range.

1. `[abc]` - one of "a", "b", or "c"
1. `[a-z]` - between the range of "a" to "z".

You can also line this up with a "!" to mean not in the following bracket.

1. `[!abc]` - not one of "a", "b", or "c"
1. `[!a-z]` - not in the range of "a" to "z"

The examples above are used in UNIX-based systems. These commands are slightly different in Window's Powershell and SQL. For more information about those systems, you can read [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) about globs.

## Node Example

```js
var glob = require("glob")

// options is optional
glob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {
	// files is an array of filenames.
	// If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing
	// was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]
	// er is an error object or null.
})
```
