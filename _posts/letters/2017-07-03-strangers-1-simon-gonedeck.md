## Introduction

Welcome to the next installment of the Jear-Bear Letters. After a brief three 
hiatus, we're back with a new series called Seven Degrees of Strangers.

The title is a play on "Seven Degrees of Separation" where you are at most 
seven links away from knowing any random stranger on Earth. So if I met a 
stranger on the street, I could trace them to at most seven degrees of 
separation until I found a connection.

Over the course of the next 7 weeks, I will write about the conversation I 
have with 7 people, each one degree of separation away. You'll get to hear 
their stories and experiences, and how I relate to them. At the end of each 
interview, I will ask the participant to choose the next person for me to 
interview. 

The conversation topic starts with understanding where the person is in life. 
Then it can go anywhere. I will develop themes as I continue to interview. 

### Why are you doing this project?

It started with a thought about connections. On LinkedIn, you can see 
potential new friends who are second or third degrees of separation. I 
wondered who are these people. How does everyone know each other? If I continue down the path of separations, could I meet someone famous?

Then in May, while I was conceiving the idea for this series, I went to a talk 
with Bill Burnnett and Dave Evans. They are professors at Stanford who wrote a 
book called "Designing Your Life". In their talk, they asked everyone to turn 
to their side, speak with their neighbor, and ask them something you need help 
with. I introduced myself to my neighbor and asked about a question about 
appropriative technologies. She had no idea, and once I described what that 
was, she still didn't know how to help, but she could direct me to someone she 
knew.

I pondered about the interaction for a week. It's not an everyday feeling for 
me to ask for help from strangers. Even though the woman didn't know someone 
directly, she knew of someone who could get me closer to my answer. This 
project is my excuse to practice that power of connectedness.

Throughout the series, we'll find out what connectedness means to other 
people. And hopefully, I'll build a new connection by the end of our 
conversation.

## The First Degree of Separation

To begin this series, I reached out to my friend, Simon Gonedeck. He's an entrepreneur and web developer for his own consulting company, MG Web Partners. Besides catching up with an friend, I wanted to probe him about starting a company. Simon did not disappoint. In our conversation, he went over that and so much more.

## Enter Simon

Simon's a recent grad from the University of St. Thomas with a B.S. in accounting. I met Simon three years ago at a software bootcamp. I got Simon to join my team for the final project where we built a social network for upcoming Memorials. 

We paired programmed a few times and hung out outside of the program. I got Simon to join our final team project where we created a social network for grieving. Simon was a total team player and whooped my ass into gear when we took a break at the gym.

Simon's a lacrosse player, and what I consider a total athlete. Unfortunately, he was recorvering from an injury when we had the interview. I realize that he's a person to go to for my atheletic questions, so in the future, I'll be reaching out to him more.

### MG Web Partners

After the bootcamp, Simon went back to school, living in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was working at a web consulting company where he would get pennies from the contracts he was working on. An epiphany came when we was at a yoga class, and they were in need of a website. The class was trying to find a lower quote for the contract, and his friend Johnny and he drafted a counter offer. 

Out of that contract, [MG Web Partners](http://www.mgwebpartners.com/) was 
born. Simon brought on board his twin brother, Sevy, and they were in business.

*Side note*. Sevy is Simon's identical twin. I met Sevy once, and I swore I was seeing double.

#### Starting Pains

The team tried many ways of reaching out to local businesses around the area.

- Referrals
- Word of Mouth
- Social Media
- Email Marketing


Simon started working at an agency creating websites for a substantially low 
pay for work they could be getting more for if his friends and he went out and 
tried on their own.

Here's an email I got from them last June.

> My partners Johnny Mulvahill, Sevy Gondeck and I have started a web design 
> and development company called MG Web Partners.
> We specialize in building businesses remarkable websites that deliver new 
> customers and drive revenue.
>  
>  We help three kinds of companies:
>  1. Companies with outdated websites
>  2. Companies with poorly designed websites
>  3. Or Companies that just need a new website
>
> Most companies fit one of these three scenarios, so if you know of anyone,
> please forward them my contact information and I promise weâ€™ll take good
> care of them.

Since then, they have worked with clients all over the area. With all of them 
graduated, Simon and Johnny are moving forward with the business while Simon's 
twin, Sevy, is going to work for Deloitte in the fall.

#### Continual Improvements

Having Simon talk about his business reminded me how much we learn on the job.
A lot of early business pitfalls with consulting businesses came often. With 
every contract, they learned something new.

For example, drawing up proposals have been a learning process. It's better to 
make a proposal that's less stringent and allows for flexibility with the 
client. And to make the process more transparent, the company uses [Proposify](
https://www.proposify.biz/), a website that allows clients to review proposals 
while also giving the business insight into how their clients are reviewing 
their proposals.

Growing the business was tough in the beginning. They've tried driving around 
the area, trying to attract business by going door to door. But their best 
strategy was been word of mouth. Having previous clients tell potential future 
clients of their work has been more substantial than other techniques.

##### On Writing

I think the benefit of being a first connection is they know more about you. 
Because I've been writing the Jear-Bear letters for the past two years, I have 
some insight on creating a weekly writing habit. Although long time readers 
will know 2016 was a terrible year for me in weekly writing.

Simon's been one of those long-time readers, so as a follow-up in our 
conversation, he asked some advice about creating a writing habit, and how to 
get through writer's block. One of his goals is to boost [his company's blog](
http://www.mgwebpartners.com/blog/) by writing more frequently.

And because I understand the context he's talking about, I gave Simon a 
recommendation, although know that I think back on it, I have more than a 
single recommendation.

1. "Bird by Bird" by Anne Lammont
That book has been freeing to me. It taught me I can give myself permission to
write freely without having to worry about making the best piece of writing
from the start with the concept of "shitty first drafts". There's also much on
being successful as a writer, which is to say
don't expect success. As counter-intuitive as it may be, that piece of advice
helped me release what I consider terrible writing to my letter friends. A few
of those letters have been very well received, like my "Caltrain Suicides" letter and my "Lost Keys" letter
2. [Seth Godin's Blog](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/)
If we're talking about prolific, it doesn't get as good as Seth Godin's blog,
which he has been serving for over the past decade. He's the prime example of
less is more, which has helped me in editing down my own writing much less.
3. Peer Reviews
Earlier on in my letter writing, I decided to open up each letter for critique.
I reached out on Twitter to see who could be my critique, and a few people
helped me <a href="#shout-out">(1)</a>. I'd send a draft out, and they would give me some helpful criticism.
I remember Helin gave me some pointers about sub-headers, which I didn't
initially like, but has grown on me.  
Unfortunately, I stopped because my critiques wouldn't come back before my
deadline, so I carried along hoping my audience would tell me. Turns out, they
don't, so this project is to help me out further because I'm working alongside
an illustrator. While the illustrator's primary job is not to be a critic, it
does help to have a second eye. Plus, if I'm really stuck on something, I'll
drag a friend into it. Stephen King wrote in "On Writing" that his wife reads
through his novels before he releases them.

<a id="shout-out">(1)</a>Shout outs to [Helin](https://twitter.com/helin_s)
and [Isaac](https://twitter.com/j12coder).

##### Growth Hacking

Also, Simon asked about Growth Hacking, even though he didn't use those words.
"How do I grow readership?" I ask myself the same questions. For an individual,
it takes years to earn credibility. For a company, it takes referrals and
tailoring the message to potential new clients. And for that, you can be very
targeted in your approach.

Release on schedule.

Newsletters: don't take un-subscriptions personally.

### Take-aways

I asked Simon what's his the thing he wants people to take away with.

Over-communicate with clients. It might not always be clear what they want.
Don't do it over email. Do it over the phone or in-person, if you can.

Like myself, Simon's got a lot going on in his life. I can learn a lot more by 
saying "no" more often and taking on fewer things.


### Follow-up Questions

Simon got to ask me a few questions at the end.


## Side Note

I recorded our conversation, but my recording app cut out a half an hour in, so I can only review our first half of our conversation. Some of this piece is relying from memory.


## Addendum

The project is a mix of two projects. The first is Megan Gilbert's blog, "52 
Cups of Tea". In that blog, she interviews a person a week over tea or coffee 
in preparation for getting prepared for finding a job in the real world 
outside of college.

The second is Kio Stark's newsletter and book talking to strangers. In the 
series, Kio recounts stories she has with starngers in NYC. She keeps 
reminding me I want to talk with random people and share worldviews.

For the old readers, thanks for your patience. I know it's months between the 
last newsletter, and I'm really happy to share the next few weeks with you. 
And to the new readers, I hope you'll love what you're about to read.
