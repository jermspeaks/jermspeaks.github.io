## Introduction

Welcome to the next installment of the Jear-Bear Letters. After a brief three 
hiatus, we're back with a new series called Seven Degrees of Strangers.

The title is a play on "Seven Degrees of Separation" where you are at most 
seven links away from knowing any random stranger on Earth. So if I met a 
stranger on the street, I could trace them to at most seven degrees of 
separation until I found a connection.

Over the course of the next 7 weeks, I will write about the conversation I 
have with 7 people, each one degree of separation away. You'll get to hear 
their stories and experiences, and how I relate to them. At the end of each 
interview, I will ask the participant to choose the next person for me to 
interview. 

The conversation topic starts with understanding where the person is in life. 
Then it can go anywhere. I will develop themes as I continue to interview. 

### Why are you doing this project?  

Facebook and LinkedIn capitalize on first, second and third degrees of 
separation. I wondered who are these people, and can I connect with them on a 
personal basis as much as a first degree connection.

I'm hoping to have a deeper understanding about connections. I define a 
connection as a friend I can hang out with. Throughout the series, we'll find 
out what connections mean to other people. And hopefully, I'll build a new 
connection by the end of our conversation.

I'm also hoping to hone my interviewing skills. At the very least, I love 
stories and I want strangers to tell me theirs. Quite contrary to the popular 
advise not to talk to strangers.

### Inspiration

The project is a mix of two projects. The first is Megan Gilbert's blog, "52 
Cups of Tea". In that blog, she interviews a person a week over tea or coffee 
in preparation for getting prepared for finding a job in the real world 
outside of college.

The second is Kio Stark's newsletter and book talking to strangers. In the 
series, Kio recounts stories she has with starngers in NYC. She keeps 
reminding me I want to talk with random people and share worldviews.

For the old readers, thanks for your patience. I know it's months between the 
last newsletter, and I'm really happy to share the next few weeks with you. 
And to the new readers, I hope you'll love what you're about to read.

## The First Degree of Separation

...

## Enter Simon

Simon Gonedeck a fun guy to talk to. We know each other from DevBootcamp
back in 2014. He was my in my cohort, and one of the youngest folks to enter
the bootcamp. Incidentally, not the youngest.

He recently graduated from University of St. Thomas, living in St. Paul /
Minneapolis area, working at his consulting firm, MG Web Partners along with
his twin brother Sevy and friend Johnny, who also went to DevBootcamp.

Simon's a lacrosse player, total athlete. Got my ass in gear from HIT when we
were at the bootcamp. He's recovering from an injury. In our conversation, we 
talk business. About his firm, MG Web Partners, about dealing with partners, 
and dealing with the business side.

Like myself, Simon's got a lot going on in his life. I can learn a lot more by 
saying "no" more often and taking on fewer things.

### MG Web Partners

Simon's a co-founder of the web consulting agency, MG Web Partners.
Along with his friend Johnny and his twin Sevy, they run a tight operation
working with local businesses around the area.

#### How it got started

Simon started working at an agency creating websites for a substantially low 
pay for work they could be getting more for if his friends and he went out and 
tried on their own.

Here's an email I got from them last June.

> My partners Johnny Mulvahill, Sevy Gondeck and I have started a web design 
> and development company called MG Web Partners.
> We specialize in building businesses remarkable websites that deliver new 
> customers and drive revenue.
>  
>  We help three kinds of companies:
>  1. Companies with outdated websites
>  2. Companies with poorly designed websites
>  3. Or Companies that just need a new website
>
> Most companies fit one of these three scenarios, so if you know of anyone,
> please forward them my contact information and I promise weâ€™ll take good
> care of them.

Since then, they have worked with clients all over the area. With all of them 
graduated, Simon and Johnny are moving forward with the business while Simon's 
twin, Sevy, is going to work for Deloitte in the fall.

#### Continual Improvements

Having Simon talk about his business reminded me how much we learn on the job.
A lot of early business pitfalls with consulting businesses came often. With 
every contract, they learned something new.

For example, drawing up proposals have been a learning process. It's better to 
make a proposal that's less stringent and allows for flexibility with the 
client. And to make the process more transparent, the company uses [Proposify](
https://www.proposify.biz/), a website that allows clients to review proposals 
while also giving the business insight into how their clients are reviewing 
their proposals.

Growing the business was tough in the beginning. They've tried driving around 
the area, trying to attract business by going door to door. But their best 
strategy was been word of mouth. Having previous clients tell potential future 
clients of their work has been more substantial than other techniques.

##### On Writing

I think the benefit of being a first connection is they know more about you. 
Because I've been writing the Jear-Bear letters for the past two years, I have 
some insight on creating a weekly writing habit. Although long time readers 
will know 2016 was a terrible year for me in weekly writing.

Simon's been one of those long-time readers, so as a follow-up in our 
conversation, he asked some advice about creating a writing habit, and how to 
get through writer's block. One of his goals is to boost [his company's blog](
http://www.mgwebpartners.com/blog/) by writing more frequently.

And because I understand the context he's talking about, I gave Simon a 
recommendation, although know that I think back on it, I have more than a 
single recommendation.

1. "Bird by Bird" by Anne Lammont
That book has been freeing to me. It taught me I can give myself permission to
write freely without having to worry about making the best piece of writing
from the start with the concept of "shitty first drafts". There's also much on
being successful as a writer, which is to say
don't expect success. As counter-intuitive as it may be, that piece of advice
helped me release what I consider terrible writing to my letter friends. A few
of those letters have been very well received, like my "Caltrain Suicides" letter and my "Lost Keys" letter
2. [Seth Godin's Blog](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/)
If we're talking about prolific, it doesn't get as good as Seth Godin's blog,
which he has been serving for over the past decade. He's the prime example of
less is more, which has helped me in editing down my own writing much less.
3. Peer Reviews
Earlier on in my letter writing, I decided to open up each letter for critique.
I reached out on Twitter to see who could be my critique, and a few people
helped me <a href="#shout-out">(1)</a>. I'd send a draft out, and they would give me some helpful criticism.
I remember Helin gave me some pointers about sub-headers, which I didn't
initially like, but has grown on me.  
Unfortunately, I stopped because my critiques wouldn't come back before my
deadline, so I carried along hoping my audience would tell me. Turns out, they
don't, so this project is to help me out further because I'm working alongside
an illustrator. While the illustrator's primary job is not to be a critic, it
does help to have a second eye. Plus, if I'm really stuck on something, I'll
drag a friend into it. Stephen King wrote in "On Writing" that his wife reads
through his novels before he releases them.

<a id="shout-out">(1)</a>Shout outs to [Helin](https://twitter.com/helin_s)
and [Isaac](https://twitter.com/j12coder).

##### Growth Hacking

Also, Simon asked about Growth Hacking, even though he didn't use those words.
"How do I grow readership?" I ask myself the same questions. For an individual,
it takes years to earn credibility. For a company, it takes referrals and
tailoring the message to potential new clients. And for that, you can be very
targeted in your approach.

Release on schedule.

Newsletters: don't take un-subscriptions personally.

### Take-aways

I asked Simon what's his the thing he wants people to take away with.

Over-communicate with clients. It might not always be clear what they want.
Don't do it over email. Do it over the phone or in-person, if you can.

### Follow-up Questions

Simon got to ask me a few questions at the end.
