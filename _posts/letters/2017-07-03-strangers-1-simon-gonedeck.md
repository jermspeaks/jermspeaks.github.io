## Introduction

Welcome to season 3 of the Jear Bear Letters.
After a brief three month hiatus, we're back with a new series called
Seven Degrees of Strangers.

It's like the saying, "Seven Degrees of Separation", or "Seven Degrees of Kevin Bacon".
This comes from researchers, with whom created I don't know, that say human kind's connections are 
seven degrees of knowing one another.
So if I met a stranger on the street, I could trace them to at most seven degrees of separation until I found a connection.
Except this has nothing to do with ancestry.com.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I'm talking to strangers.

It's got all to do with connection and conversation.
The premise is to have an interview with someone I know,
and at the end of the conversation, have that person recommend me someone else to talk to.
Rinse and repeat with the next interview 7 times.

Or in total 8 interviewees. The topic: it's free-for-all.
The inspiration: you'd think it would be Tim Ferriss' podcast.
Except it's not.
I got the idea from Megan of 52 Cups of Tea. 
In that blog, she interviews a person a week over tea or coffee
in preparation for getting prepared for finding a job in the real world
outside of college.

Like her blog, just sit back and enjoy some phenomenal people I got to interview over the last few months.
And a few more to continue towards the later part of next month.

## Simon Gonedeck

Enter Simon. He's a fun guy to talk to. We know each other from DevBoocamp back in 2014.
He was my in my cohort, and one of the youngest folks to enter the boocamp.
Incedentally, not the youngest.

He recently graduated from University of Minnesota, living in St. Paul/Minneapolis area,
working at his consulting firm, MG Web Partners along with his brother Sebi and friend Johnny,
who also went to DevBootcamp.

Simon's a lacrosse player, total athelete. Whoop my ass from HIT when we were at the bootcamp.
In our conversation, we talk business. About his firm, MG Web Partners,
about dealing with partners, and dealing with the business side. 

### Current Affairs



### MG Web Partners

### Take-aways

Over-communicate with clients. It might not always be clear what they want. 
Don't do it over email. Do it over the phone or in-person, if you can. 

### Follow-up Questions

Simon got to ask me a few questions at the end.
