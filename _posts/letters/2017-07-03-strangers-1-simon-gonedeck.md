## Introduction

Welcome to season 3 of the Jear-Bear Letters. After a brief three month hiatus, we're back with a new series called **Seven Degrees of Strangers**.

It's like the saying, "Seven Degrees of Separation", or "Seven Degrees of Kevin
Bacon". This comes from researchers, with whom created I don't know, that say
human kind's connections are seven degrees of knowing one another. So if I met
a stranger on the street, I could trace them to at most seven degrees of
separation until I found a connection. Except this has nothing to do with ancestry.com. And it has nothing to do with the fact I'm talking to strangers.

It's got all to do with connection and conversation.
The premise is to have an interview with someone I know,
and at the end of the conversation, have that person recommend me someone else
to talk to. Rinse and repeat with the next interview 7 times.

Or in total 8 interviewees. The topic: it's free-for-all. The inspiration:
you'd think it would be Tim Ferriss' podcast. Except it's not. I got the idea
from Megan of 52 Cups of Tea. In that blog, she interviews a person a week over
tea or coffee in preparation for getting prepared for finding a job in the real
world outside of college.

Like her blog, just sit back and enjoy some phenomenal people I got to
interview over the last few months. And a few more to continue towards the
later part of next month.

## Simon Gonedeck

Enter Simon. He's a fun guy to talk to. We know each other from DevBootcamp
back in 2014. He was my in my cohort, and one of the youngest folks to enter
the bootcamp. Incidentally, not the youngest.

He recently graduated from University of St. Thomas, living in St. Paul /
Minneapolis area, working at his consulting firm, MG Web Partners along with
his twin brother Sevy and friend Johnny, who also went to DevBootcamp.

Simon's a lacrosse player, total athlete. Got my ass in gear from HIT when we
were at the bootcamp. He's recovering from an injury. In our conversation, we talk business. About his firm, MG Web Partners, about dealing with partners, and dealing with the business side.

Like myself, Simon's got a lot going on in his life.
I can learn a lot more by saying "no" more often and taking on fewer things.

### MG Web Partners

Simon's a co-founder of the web consulting agency, MG Web Partners.
Along with his friend Johnny and his twin Sevy, they run a tight operation
working with local businesses around the area.

#### How it got started

Simon started working at an agency creating websites for a substantially low pay
for work they could be getting more for if his friends and he went out and tried on their own.

Here's an email I got from them last June.

> My partners Johnny Mulvahill, Sevy Gondeck and I have started a web design and development company called MG Web Partners.
> We specialize in building businesses remarkable websites that deliver new customers and drive revenue.
>  
>  We help three kinds of companies:
>  1. Companies with outdated websites
>  2. Companies with poorly designed websites
>  3. Or Companies that just need a new website
>
> Most companies fit one of these three scenarios, so if you know of anyone,
> please forward them my contact information and I promise weâ€™ll take good
> care of them.

Since then, they have worked with clients all over the area.
With all of them graduated, Simon and Johnny are moving forward with the business
while Simon's twin, Sevy, is going to work for Deloitte in the fall.

#### Continual Improvements

Having Simon talk about his business reminded me how much we learn on the job.
A lot of early business pitfalls with consulting businesses came often.
With every contract, they learned something new.

For example, drawing up proposals have been a learning process.
It's better to make a proposal that's less stringent and allows for flexibility with the client.
And to make the process more transparent, the company uses [Proposify](https://www.proposify.biz/),
a website that allows clients to review proposals while also giving the business
insight into how their clients are reviewing their proposals.

Growing the business was tough in the beginning.
They've tried driving around the area, trying to attract business by going door to door.
But their best strategy was been word of mouth.
Having previous clients tell potential future clients of their work has been more substantial
than other techniques.

##### On Writing

I think the benefit of being a first connection is they know more about you.
Because I've been writing the Jear-Bear letters for the past two years,
I have some insight on creating a weekly writing habit.
Although long time readers will know 2016 was a terrible year for me
in weekly writing.

Simon's been one of those long-time readers, so as a follow-up in our conversation,
he asked some advice about creating a writing habit, and how to get through writer's block.
One of his goals is to boost [his company's blog](http://www.mgwebpartners.com/blog/)
by writing more frequently.

And because I understand the context he's talking about, I gave Simon a recommendation,
although know that I think back on it, I have more than a single recommendation.

1. "Bird by Bird" by Anne Lammont
That book has been freeing to me. It taught me I can give myself permission to
write freely without having to worry about making the best piece of writing
from the start with the concept of "shitty first drafts". There's also much on
being successful as a writer, which is to say
don't expect success. As counter-intuitive as it may be, that piece of advice
helped me release what I consider terrible writing to my letter friends. A few
of those letters have been very well received, like my "Caltrain Suicides" letter and my "Lost Keys" letter
2. [Seth Godin's Blog](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/)
If we're talking about prolific, it doesn't get as good as Seth Godin's blog,
which he has been serving for over the past decade. He's the prime example of
less is more, which has helped me in editing down my own writing much less.
3. Peer Reviews
Earlier on in my letter writing, I decided to open up each letter for critique.
I reached out on Twitter to see who could be my critique, and a few people
helped me <a href="#shout-out">(1)</a>. I'd send a draft out, and they would give me some helpful criticism.
I remember Helin gave me some pointers about sub-headers, which I didn't
initially like, but has grown on me.  
Unfortunately, I stopped because my critiques wouldn't come back before my
deadline, so I carried along hoping my audience would tell me. Turns out, they
don't, so this project is to help me out further because I'm working alongside
an illustrator. While the illustrator's primary job is not to be a critic, it
does help to have a second eye. Plus, if I'm really stuck on something, I'll
drag a friend into it. Stephen King wrote in "On Writing" that his wife reads
through his novels before he releases them.

<a id="shout-out">(1)</a>Shout outs to [Helin](https://twitter.com/helin_s)
and [Isaac](https://twitter.com/j12coder).

##### Growth Hacking

Also, Simon asked about Growth Hacking, even though he didn't use those words.
"How do I grow readership?" I ask myself the same questions. For an individual,
it takes years to earn credibility. For a company, it takes referrals and
tailoring the message to potential new clients. And for that, you can be very
targeted in your approach.

Release on schedule.

Newsletters: don't take un-subscriptions personally.

### Take-aways

I asked Simon what's his the thing he wants people to take away with.

Over-communicate with clients. It might not always be clear what they want.
Don't do it over email. Do it over the phone or in-person, if you can.

### Follow-up Questions

Simon got to ask me a few questions at the end.
