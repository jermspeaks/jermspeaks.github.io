## Introduction

Welcome to season 3 of the Jear Bear Letters.
After a brief three month hiatus, we're back with a new series called
Seven Degrees of Strangers.

It's like the saying, "Seven Degrees of Separation", or "Seven Degrees of Kevin Bacon".
This comes from researchers, with whom created I don't know, that say human kind's connections are 
seven degrees of knowing one another.
So if I met a stranger on the street, I could trace them to at most seven degrees of separation until I found a connection.
Except this has nothing to do with ancestry.com.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I'm talking to strangers.

It's got all to do with connection and conversation.
The premise is to have an interview with someone I know,
and at the end of the conversation, have that person recommend me someone else to talk to.
Rinse and repeat with the next interview 7 times.

Or in total 8 interviewees. The topic: it's free-for-all.
The inspiration: you'd think it would be Tim Ferriss' podcast.
Except it's not.
I got the idea from Megan of 52 Cups of Tea. 
In that blog, she interviews a person a week over tea or coffee
in preparation for getting prepared for finding a job in the real world
outside of college.

Like her blog, just sit back and enjoy some phenomenal people I got to interview over the last few months.
And a few more to continue towards the later part of next month.

## Simon Gonedeck

Enter Simon. He's a fun guy to talk to. We know each other from DevBoocamp back in 2014.
He was my in my cohort, and one of the youngest folks to enter the boocamp.
Incedentally, not the youngest.

He recently graduated from University of St. Thomas, living in St. Paul/Minneapolis area,
working at his consulting firm, MG Web Partners along with his brother Sebi and friend Johnny,
who also went to DevBootcamp.

Simon's a lacrosse player, total athelete. Got my ass in gear from HIT when we were at the bootcamp.
He's recovering from an injury.
In our conversation, we talk business. About his firm, MG Web Partners,
about dealing with partners, and dealing with the business side. 

Like myself, Simon's got a lot going on in his life.
I can learn a lot more by saying "no" more often and taking on fewer things.

### MG Web Partners

Simon's a co-founder of the web consulting agency, MG Web Partners.
Along with his friend Johnny and his twin Sevy, they run a tight operation
working with local businesses around the area.

#### How it got started

Simon started working at an agency creating websites for a substantially low pay
for work they could be getting more for if his friends and he went out and tried on their own.

Here's an email I got from them last June.

> My partners Johnny Mulvahill, Sevy Gondeck and I have started a web design and development company called MG Web Partners. 
> We specialize in building businesses remarkable websites that deliver new customers and drive revenue.
>  
>  We help three kinds of companies:
>  1. Companies with outdated websites
>  2. Companies with poorly designed websites
>  3. Or Companies that just need a new website
>
>  Most companies fit one of these three scenarios, so if you know of anyone, 
>  please forward them my contact information and I promise weâ€™ll take good care of them.

Since then, they have worked with clients all over the area. 
With all of them graduated, Simon and Johnny are moving forward with the business
while Simon's twin, Sevy, is going to work for Deloitte in the fall.

#### Continual Improvements

Having Simon talk about his business reminded me how much we learn on the job.
A lot of early business pitfalls with consulting businesses came often.
With every contract, they learned something new.

For example, drawing up proposals have been a learning process.
It's better to make a proposal that's less stringent and allows for flexibility with the client.
And to make the process more transparent, the company uses [Proposify](https://www.proposify.biz/),
a website that allows clients to review proposals while also giving the business
insight into how their clients are reviewing their proposals.

Growing the business was tough in the beginning.
They've tried driving around the area, trying to attract business by going door to door.
But their best strategy was been word of mouth. 
Having previous clients tell potential future clients of their work has been more substantial
than other techniques.

### Take-aways

I asked Simon what's his the thing he wants people to take away with.

Over-communicate with clients. It might not always be clear what they want. 
Don't do it over email. Do it over the phone or in-person, if you can. 

### Follow-up Questions

Simon got to ask me a few questions at the end.
