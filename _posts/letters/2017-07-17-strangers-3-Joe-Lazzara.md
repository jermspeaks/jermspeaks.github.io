## Introduction

Evan wanted to steer the strangers to come in a different direction. To do that, Evan choose someone who knew a lot of people in a lot of different places. He prefaced that his father's friend, Joe Lazzara, walked an unconventional path.

Before diving into the interview, I glanced over Joe's butcher shop's website. The only thing that stood out to me was the shop was in Carmel, Indiana. I've never been there, and was curious to hear how Joe's path took him there.

## Enter Joe Lazzara

Joe Lazarra is Evan's father's very close friend. Evan's father Charlie met Joe in college as they were part of the same fraternity. They remain very close that when Joe's father (or was it mother) passed away a few years ago, Joe told me Charlie was sure as hell there for him.

I wasn't expecting Joe to be a masterful storyteller. He didn't disappoint. I asked Joe to tell his story, and he transported me further back than I was expecting. If you ever talk to him, he has a very solid sense of self.

Joe talked about his heritage from Sicily. This was over a century ago, and the Silicans were known to be the outsiders. Amongst themselves, they cared a lot for their family, culture, and food. A few decades later, Joe's grandparents migrate to the US running grocery stores. Generations of his family was built around the food. It didn't matter if they were in Italy or the US. That's where it all starts.

## Early Years

His eldest brother's 18 years older than him. And their father made a vow to get them all through college. And his father fulfilled his wish with all 5 of his siblings, including himself, went through college.

In college, Joe studied Quantatative analysis, which during the mid to late
80's, was the thing to study and get a great job. Joe started off working at a
software consulting job. Certain events led Joe into the telecomm business
when his job took an unexpected turn. At the software job, the HR manager took
the 401k pension to Florida and used that money to deal or smuggle drugs. The
DEA and FBI took whiff, and Joe exited as soon as he heard, disentangling
himself from that mess.

He was in sales with GTE selling to areas around the U.S. telecomm services.
That was until Verizon bought them out. He worked for small business,
start-ups, VCs, doing early work in VOIP and selling high speed Internet to
homes. He was a top executive at one of these companies until the 2001
attacks, and a struggle tech recession from the dot com bust, made it
unreasonable to continue as head of sales. Surprisingly, that company still
exists even with the executives gone 16 years later. It's a sign the employees
are more important to keep the ground running.

After that, he consulted for a few years. But Joe grew tired on traveling
around. One side-effect of traveling is Joe really loved food, and seeked out
good restaurants. He was a frequent to some up and coming places,
restauranteers thought he was a food critic.

## Butchershop

Joe was thinking about what to do next. He knew he didn't want to continue working in telecomm. He thought about running a restaurant, but when presenting this idea to his wife, she reminded him about the long hours that would be and what that meant for his young children. So he searched around again, (and he got to talking to the mayor of the city, and he was telling Joe how they could use a butchershop.) -> Check facts.

Joe presented this idea to his wife, and she agreed. They put about a year of work into opening the shop before it opened. The first year's return was at a loss, but since then, they've been on the up. They're netting a few million a year, and it has become such an integral piece to the community. 

Joe tells me it's not about the money anymore. It's all about giving back to the people. It's the satisfaction knowing you're delivering the turkey to your customer's home during Thanksgiving. It's about the stories their customers talk to them about. Early on, Joe wanted to franchise the business and build many "Joe's Butchershops". Now, Joe wants to make his shop iconic, much like Ann Arbor's ??, or San Francisco's Gheridelli's Square. Carmel is an up and coming, affluent city, about an hour or two away from Indianapolis. People from all over the state come to visit the butcher shop.

There was an old couple that used to visit Joe's butchershop every week. They loved talking to Joe. When Joe noticed they didn't come one week, he was concerned. The following week, he
