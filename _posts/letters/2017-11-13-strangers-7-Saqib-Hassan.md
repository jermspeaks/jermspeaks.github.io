## Introduction

Hello letter friends,

This is my last letter for the series, "Seven Degrees of Strangers". If you haven't followed the journey, you can check it out on [my website](). For the past 6 weeks, I've written about 6 different people I talked to one degree of separation apart.

For this last letter, Raina recommended I talk to Saqib, someone she's worked with to make her training material better.

## Enter Saqib Hassan

Saqib is a co-founder of TrainingFolks. Training folks helps with training services for businesses. In his business, he'll work with customers to help them with traning material, consult with training, etc.

Saqib wasn't interested in telling me life stories. Instead, he asked the purpose of the conversation. In a way, this was a conversation of the purpose of reaching out to connections of connections. I stumbled a bit, fumbling around trying to understand what this entire series has been culminating to.

To Saqib, the value proposition must be there in order to reach out. Because Raina and Saqib clicked working on a project doesn't necessarily mean my conversation with Saqib had a purpose. I understand this and had little value proposition. 

I've got a keen interested in learning more about people. And essentially, that's what I got. Saqib's view on networking is an exchange of goods and services. This can fall in the form of finding business partners, selling products, making friends, finding lovers. 

In a way, I'm at fault because I was searching for a meaning that wasn't really there.

So, I'm at the crossroads. Do I interview someone else or leave this at this? In a way, this is the most anti-climatic conversation in this series. But at the same time, it's the most real. Everyone else has been telling me about their lives that there was little conversation. 

And interviews are not a two way exchange than a one way exchange of information. Saqib says it's much harder to connect with a second or third connection. However, if I have learned something from this series, that does not have to be the case. Maybe I would have this conversation with someone from earlier, but what strikes this much less than before is everyone's interest in people.

"Not everyone's interested," is my conclusion. And to Saqib and everyone else, I'm sorry this may not live up to the series. But I'm fine with this. Life doesn't give you all the answers, and some people really don't have much to offer when I'm not looking for those things they do offer. 

Yeah, you can tell I'm a little sad about the conversation. Mostly because I've hyped myself. But also, I don't have a reason to talk to Saqib other than finishing this series. So let it be, I say. And the lessons I learned from him and everyone before has been invaluable. 

## Takeaway message

Have a purpose for reaching out to someone. Understand what you're offering them and what they can offer for you.
