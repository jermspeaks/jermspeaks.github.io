## Introduction

<!-- 
- How did Mary introduce me to Julie?
 -->

If you haven't followed along with this newsletter series, I'm interviewing strangers one degree of separation at a time. My last interviewee, Mary Aipoalani, gave me too many choices on who to interview next. I was in choice paralysis until I received this text from Mary. "You need to connect with her. I just told her about you."

Attached to the text was a VCard, a digital business card that makes it easy to add them to your contacts list. Or at least in theory it's supposed to be easy. I had the complication of incompatible file formats. Android phones hate Apple's VCards attachments. If you ever run into this problem, save the VCard text to a computer and add it to your contacts online. And if you're a iOS or Android developer, please make this integration easier in the future.

## Enter Julie Valenti

Julie has a hidden agenda. She helps people re-wire their brain so they can be more alive. If people are more alive, they can become contributes and producers. If people are more alive, they consume less.

Let's step back for a moment. Who is Julie? She's a new resident of San Diego. She moved here because she'd rather soak up the sun than live in a cloudy and low-lit place like Portland, Oregon. She resided in Portland for the past 23 years, and she sufferred from SAD - Seasonal Affective Disorder. When Julie's friend invited her to come out to San Diego months ago, she knew she had to move there. 

Besides being a sun worshipper, Julie's also the owner of Portland's Wisdom and Recovery Wellness Center. She works with patients who suffer from PTSD introduced from childhood. Julie's clinic has been around for over a decade, although Julie has been in practice from much longer. 

Julie is also an author. She wrote a book called "Knowing How: The 20 Concepts to Rewiring Your Brain" based off her practice.

From our conversation, I could tell Julie had a lot of energy. We will dive into motherhood, her work, and her book.

### Empty Nest Syndrome

<!-- 
- Grief and Neurological Role
- Relationship with her sons
- How to talk to my mother
 -->

Julie has two children, and both of them have moved away. One moved to Los Angeles. The other in Portland. At least I believe so, at the time of this writing. One reason Julie did not hesitate to move to San Diego was her youngest son lives nearby, in Los Angeles.

I was very curious how Julie dealt with her children moved away. I wanted to know the mother's perspective on empty nest syndrome. As Julie explains it to me, "empty nest syndrome" is a fancy term for grief. Now that the children are gone, the mother grieves, and the grieving process isn't an easy road. 

What can help is to discuss what the role of mother and child are now, and to develop boundaries of where each one lies. The compromise of each party is how we should resolve this mental conflict. For Julie, that was to have a conversation with her son in LA about how often they would talk over the phone. It would be how often they would meet up since Julie lives within driving distance to her son. Or it's how much space they needed from each other so Julie wouldn't be suffucating her child.

I asked Julie about this because I am facing a similar situation with my mother. My sister, the youngest sibling, has left the nest. My mother hasn't been dealing with empty nest symdrome head on. If Julie's right, my mother didn't enter the grieving process. Instead, my mother's had acted in avoidance of the issues. Julie says, grieving requires 

And in a way, I wanted to have this conversation with my mother. I asked Julie about this, and by the end of our conversation, I had a task, to reach out to my mother and have this conversation. I haven't had this conversation with my mother yet. When I initiate that conversation, I'll take Julie's advice and listen to my mother's grief.

### Wisdom and Recovery Wellness Center

Despite some challenges along the way, Julie made it work. She's a mother of two and runs a wellness center in Portland, Oregon. She spends some time every two weeks up in Portland to help with logistics for the center, then takes clients remotely. Living it up, I'd jokingly say. And I can't blame her; I'd rather be in the sun too. 

Julie works with patients who suffer from PTSD introduced from childhood. 

### The Hidden Agenda

Julie talks about her "hidden agenda". By helping people re-wire their brain, she encourages people to be more alive. If people are more alive, they can become contributors and producers. If people are more alive, they consume less. 

I've heard this phrase somewhere else. Esther Perel was interviewed on the podcast, Design Matters, talking about how couples feel more alive when they first meet than years into the relationship. During a mid-life crisis, a person may talk of the experience as feeling alive again. Hormones are the bridge between feeling alive and living without elation.

### Brain, Hormones and Neuroplasticity

Julie touched on the difference between needs and desires. A desire can be substituted with a want. A need is a necessity to keep living. Necessities such as food and shelter. Desires are linked to dopamine receptors. When released, they trigger our reward center.

Our brain can be broken down to the survival portion and our intelligent portion. The intelligent portion is our consciousness, our prefrontal lobe. The survival portion has been called the animal brain, or survival brain. Evolutionary psychologists theorize humans had a point in history where a pre-frontal lobe began to form, yet we share similar tendancies to animals. 

The reward center is linked to our survival brain, our Amygdala. Many human behaviors are linked to how we handle situations. With trauma, we rely on keeping ourselves safe, activiting neurons that lead us to make safe decisions. Hence the safe brain.

There was a myth that your brain is fixed, unable to un-learn the past, after a certain age. However, recent research shows this is not the case. They formed a concept called neuroplasticity. Unlike the fixed concept, neuroplasticity says your brain is able to change by rewiring it. Neurons that wire together fire together. By taking the time to learn or un-learn, the brain will form neuropathways that forms new habits.

Carol Dweck wrote a book about this called "The Growth Mindset". In the book, Dweck describes and differentiates between fixed mindsets and growth mindsets. Dweck talks of people with fixed mindsets are less prone to take risks and fail. She talks about how people with fixed mindsets shut down after unable to do specific tasks. On the contrary, people with a growth mindset allow for failure and learn from mistakes and try again. In reality, everyone is a little of both, where we allow for failure in some aspects of our lives, growth mindset, and we are set in our ways in others, fixed mindset. 

### Rewiring Communication

I had the chance to read Julie's book on a plane ride from San Jose to St. Louis. The book is for people with childhood PTSD (post-trumatic stress syndrome) and therapists who work with patients with childhood PTSD. I realize the book isn't only for those readers though. As I progressed in the book, I realized this is a book I'll be coming back to over and over. The reason is there are concepts in the book I currently struggle with, the biggest being communication.

In the book, Julie describes her past, explains the reasons for the 20 concepts and how to use them, then goes over each concept in detail with a self-assessment at the end of each concept. The concepts and self-assessments are the result of Julie's work for the past few decades. As I started answering some of the questions, I realized where some of my pitfalls are. I will return to the book over the course of the next few months, slowly working through the self-assessments. 

Julie makes use of this knowledge and utilizes neuroplasticity to help her patients. The self-assessments help the reader answer questions to help solidify their understanding of how the concept relates to them. Perhaps these are questions they have been avoiding. Many of the concepts have follow-ups on building habits to help them through tough situations. Or unlearning habits that have been ingrained since their childhood. The self-assessment helps the person ask what they are doing in the world, why do they do what they do based off their hardwiring, what they can do different, and how to go about doing different.

Julie recommends creating a book circle. If you'd like to participate in such a circle, please let me know and I can set up something circled around this newsletter. In any case, I won't disclose all 20 concepts in this newsletter. That would be cumbersome and repetitive. Plus, I want people to go buy this book. Instead, I'll share the takeaways that stuck with me.

The 5 part Communication Formula (p. 123 - 124)
1. Observation
	"This is what I heard or saw"
2. Thought
	"This is what I think"
3. Feeling
	"This is how I feel"
4. Analyze Desires
	"This is what I want"
5. Participate
	"Are you willing"
	- Open to compromise


### Adult Responsibility is Non-Negotiable

<!-- 
- Juile's Interest
- 20 Concepts
- Understanding myself
- Victim, Perpetrator, Rescuer Triangle
- Rewiring the brain
- Personal take on book
 -->

Julie grew up in Idaho. Her mother had an addiction to pain killers, and her addiction affected how her children were raised. Julie's upbrining and relationship to her mother was toxic. As she writes in her book, Julie talks about how her mother's dependence to legal drugs created problems at home. When the drugs weren't there, Julie's mother would turn into a different person. Julie became the caretaker for her mother. We call this the victim becoming the rescuer. 

Julie would follow this pattern as an adult. She was in relationships where her partner may have an addiction and she was there to help them. She was playing the rescuer. When she went to college, she studied psychology. 

Some therapies can be prolonged for decades. Patients come back, lie on the couch, and talk out their issues to their therapist. Rinse and repeat for years to decades, and it feel like all the therapist is there for is someone who will listen, for a hefty sum.

But Julie's program is different. She relates all of our mental problems with neuropsychology and hormone imbalances.

Survival = brain
Advise: Don't move to Portland

Julie's lived there for 23 years. The Summer months == July, August, September. Portland recrod last year: 109 degrees F

Julie feels alive in the sunlight. Active as a sun worship

SAD = seasonal affective disorder. Feel good receptors closes. Out of harms way. For survival.

Nueroscience.

The prefrontal lobe - the brain to be more functional. 18% intelligence vs survival brain

SAFE brain

Experience -> what's a need vs a desire (want)
- Need = Maslow's Hierarchy of needs
- Desires linked to dopamine receptors. 

Hormonal recipe -> share

Book writing -> Feeling Good

"Empty Nest Syndrome" is a disguise for grief and loss
- Grief and loss lead to high oxytocin levels, tied with children leaving the home. 
- The mother must come to term with adjustments
- Often tied to "mid-life crisis"
- For children, the have to understand the mother's adjustments. Evokes miral neurons.
- We feel this in our body

Make an action plan

Julie has one son in Portland, one son in LA. She must determine her wants. How much texting, visiting, email/phone call? Negotiate the terms.

The book is for therapists and people confused about their childhoods, and it's to help or need help with it
Confusing because of conflicted attachment.

They are drawn to addiction, escape, PTSD is a reaction of the organism of life being threatened.

Neuroplasticity - healing process. Approached by the 20 concepts. 

Concepts get translated into a methodology. Think / memorize.

Background

Concept
	What we do in the world
	What we do different
	How we do it
	"Ask yourself these questions"

1. Brain / Body
2. Attachment

This is part of the process. Process is split in three parts

1. Understand yourself
2. Recreate yourself
3. What you can do about it (the "how")

The last concept: "Adult Responsibility is non-negotiable"

Traditional psychotherapy costs a lot more money.

Wisdom & Recovery

Julie is a licensed hypnotherapist.

One big takeaway
- Understanding + resolving childhood
- Rewiring

Mentor / Coach to write book -> Angela

## Notes v2

"This is me. Not trying to impress."

Haven't talked to Mary in quite some time -> confidential

Owns a wellness center in Portland Oregon to help people with PTSD from childhood trauma

Developed own approach, wrote a book

Recently: San Diego - Patio of hotel "I'm going to live here"

Pool, beach, Balboa Park to ride her bike

Bringing clinicians on board at wellness center as Julie starts promotion in San Diego. A few Skype sessions

Book promotion.

Creating realities, manifesting them to move from Portland to San Diego after one visit

Hillcrest Area

5 minutes from little Italy, Marina
10 minutes from the Beach

Excited state: Survival -> calm down to intelligent -> can do anything

Portland for 23 years
- Outrageous to rent / buy in
- Freeways and roads can't support people, increase in traffic
e.g. Seattle, LA, SF
- Winters last 6 yo 7 months long: Icy, rainy, cloudy. Last winter - not going
- 3 months of summer
	- last summer broke records (109)
Sun worshipper - someone who comes alive with sunlight
*In Dark* - inside, sleepy, etc
In these areas, can be diagnosed with SAD - seasonal affective disorder
In brain, SAD

Feel good receptors close in dark environment
- Survival brain: go inside
- Retina to shut down
- Rest, protection, survival
- Unevolved survival brain = where most brain activity is in

2 different brand: subconscious vs conscious
- subconscious: surviving
- conscious: thinking

In the "cold" vs the "heat" receptors = "safe"

Balance - Needs vs. Desires (dopamine), Reward loop
- Tech people to manipulate hormonal receptors
- it's a hidden agenda: to be more alive so we can promote more contributors and producers and less consumers

Grew up in Idaho in a mining town
After HS, plane outta there

The income household

Euguene, OR: house
But racist/white bred

Moved to Portland to raise her family, divorce, leave

Empty nest syndrome

Grief & loss - more oxytocin near children (bonding hormone)

Ocytocin receptors close propels loss
- Most people don't want to feel it (don't want to experience it)
- displace it for something new / fresh (mid-life crisis)
"They should call it grief and loss"
- But it's a nature process

What do the children do?
Mother has to come to terms of what's happening. 
She must make adjustments - talk to child of what she's going through. Evoke compassion and empathy

Mirror neurons

Plan - both children see both
one son in USC. one son in PDX

How often comfortable texting, visiting, phone calls?

"What seems right to you?"

- A couple of weeks

conversation of compromise and negotiation
- How long? how much?
- mother has to be understanding of separation
- making compromise and let go

Book
for: those who need help and those who want to help
the author
conflicted attachments
moving target parents

mother - addict to amphetamines
father - avoidance
children
neuroscience + PTSD

The 5 part Communication Formula (p. 123 - 124)
1. Observation
	"This is what I heard or saw"
2. Thought
	"This is what I think"
3. Feeling
	"This is how I feel"
4. Analyze Desires
	"This is what I want"
5. Participate
	"Are you willing"
	- Open to compromise

React of organism of life theatening -> attachment

Security = good, but not everyone
Neuroplasticity - rewire & heal/amend

Confliction = **think** what concept will help you
Confusion, solved by one of the concepts + better hormones -> make a contribution to society

Each concept: info
- What we do in the world
- Why we do it based off our hardwiring
- What we do different
- How we do it? Ask yourself these questions

First concept is about the Brain & Body

Breakdown the work emotion. [e-motion]. The word contains another word, "motion".
Emotion is feeling, because we are stimulated and have a body response. "gut response"

Second - Attachment Theory

Broken down in three parts:

- Understand yourself
- Recreate same dynamics (the brain refuses to do this on its own)
- Breaking "Bad Habits"
Knowing how: this is what I do when this happens

The last third of concepts of how to do it

Psychotherapy not very effective. 
Client helped Julie develop concepts

Creating a program -> Wisdom and Recovery, The 20 concepts
Wisdom = deep down what you know
Recovery = release your authentic self

- $1,000s for 1,000 hours of therapy
- Therapist as attachment figure (rescuer)
	- Dependent situation
	- As a parent
But Julie wants them to re-wire their brains. Can't have the tools normally
Recovery: create a life, evolve human species, make a contribution to society
"Opporunities" = wake up (hidden agenda)

"Get over it" -> doesn't work. You must re-wire it

Takeaway: 
1. Understand yourself and resolve childhood conflicts
2. Rewire your brain better, be a contributor over a consumer
