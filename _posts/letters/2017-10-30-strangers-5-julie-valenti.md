## Introduction

<!-- 
- How did Mary introduce me to Julie?
 -->

Mary gave me the dilemma of too much choice. 

If you haven't followed along with this newsletter series, I'm interviewing strangers one degree of separation at a time. My last intervee, Mary Aipoalani, gave me too many choices on who to interview next. I was in choice paralysis until I get this text from Mary. "You need to connect with her. I just told her about you."

Attached to the text was a VCard, a digital business card that makes it easy to add them to your contacts list. Or at least in theory it's supposed to be easy. I had the complication of incompatible file formats. Android phones hate Apple's VCards attachments. If you ever run into this problem, save the VCard text to a computer and add it to your contacts online. And if you're a iOS or Android developer, please make this integration easier in the future.

## Enter Julie Valenti

<!-- 
- Who is Julie?
- Sun Worshipper
- Julie's practice (Wellness Center)	
 -->

When I called Julie, she was at her home in San Diego soaking up the sun. She tells me she's a sun worshipper. I had to admit, I didn't understand what that meant. Was she a follower of Ra, the Egyptian Sun God? Was she a repeat attendee to burning man? Nope, she just enjoys the sun. Living in Portland for 23 years, Julie appreciates the sun and tells me she sufferred from SAD - Seasonal Affective Disorder. Julie recently moved to San Diego so she can have all the sun she wants.

In addition to being a sun worshipper, Julie's a mother of two and runs a Wellness center in Portland, Oregon. She spends half her time working in Portland and half her time living it up in San Diego. And I can't blame her, I'd rather be in the sun as well. She spends some time every two weeks up in Portland to help with logistics for the center, then takes clients remotely.

Julie works with patients who suffer from PTSD introduced from childhood. Julie's clinic has been around for over a decade, although Julie has been in practice from much longer. From the years of practice, she wrote a book called "Knowing How: The 20 Concepts to Rewiring Your Brain".

### Adult Responsibility is Non-Negotiable

Julie grew up in Idaho with an alcoholic father and a ?? mother. When she went to college, she studied psychology. 

Some therapies can be prolonged for decades. Patients come back, lie on the couch, and talk out their issues to their therapist. Rinse and repeat for years to decades, and it feel like all the therapist is there for is someone who will listen, for a hefty sum.

But Julie's program is different. She relates all of our mental problems with neuropsychology and hormone imbalances.

### Rewiring Communication

<!-- 
- Thoughts, emotion, behavior
- Anchoring and reactions
-->

### Empty Nest Syndrome

<!-- 
- Grief and Neurological Role
- Relationship with her sons
- How to talk to my mother
 -->

Julie's got two children who have moved away. One in LA and another somewhere else. I was very curious how Julie deals with her children moved away. 
And in turn, how do I resolve my mother's requests and demands now the children have left.
As Julie explains it to me, "empty nest syndrome" is a fancy term for grief. Now that the children are gone, the mother grieves, and the grieving process isn't an easy road. 
What can help is to discuss what the role of mother and child are now, and to develop boundaries of where each one lies. The compromise of each party is how we should resolve this mental conflict. 

For Julie, that was to have a conversation with her son in LA about how often they would talk over the phone. It would be how often they would meet up since Julie lives within driving distance to her son. Or it's how much space they needed from each other so Julie wouldn't be suffucating her child. 

And in a way, I wanted to have this conversation with my mother. I asked Julie about this, and by the end of our conversation, I had a task, to reach out to my mother and have this conversation.
