## Introduction

Welcome to the Jear Bear Letter's penultimate letter of the series "Seven Degrees of Strangers". If you've just started reading this series, I interview a stranger one degree of separation at a time. And you should check out [old letters from this series on my website](http://www.craftbyzen.com/letters/season-three/). 

This week, I'm presenting a conversation I had with Raina Evans. 

## Enter Raina Evans

## Takeaway message

You never know what you're calling is. You should be open to everything.
