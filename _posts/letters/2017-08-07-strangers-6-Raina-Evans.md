## Introduction

Welcome to the Jear Bear Letter's penultimate letter of the series "Seven Degrees of Strangers". If you've just started reading this series, I interview a stranger one degree of separation at a time. And you should check out [old letters from this series on my website](http://www.craftbyzen.com/letters/season-three/). 

This week, I'm presenting a conversation I had with Raina Evans. 

## Enter Raina Evans

<!-- These are notes -->

Finished having lunch at Black Bear Diner

July training days - online training

Julie - ex-husbnad (Jonathan) - worked aat the same youth organization in the mid to late 90s. Friends through work.

Their eldest son is the same age as Raina's daughter

Raina left that organization, worked at a couple different organization until she worked on the board of the Portland Housing Center. The organization helps home owners. 

She started managing education classes to help rental housing. Organizaion wanted Raina to fill the role. Less candidates with social services, more to program management and training.

Portland Housing Center - ready to rent, the board really liked it. They asked Raina three times before she agreed to lead the class. She gave it a year, which turned to 3 years. At the end fo the 3rd year, the board decided to stop the program. PHC's director told Raina she should run it on her own. This was around the time she just got married.

In 2006, blended family. Took cirriculum to teach other teachers. Cirriculum took two years for the staff and writers to put together.

Licensed the cirriculum to other organizations. 

2007 - possession of cirriculum of "Ready to Rent"
2010 - gave copyright to Raina's org



## Takeaway message

You never know what you're calling is. You should be open to everything.
