## Introduction

<!-- Welcome to the Jear Bear Letter's penultimate letter of the series "Seven Degrees of Strangers". If you've just started reading this series, I interview a stranger one degree of separation at a time. And you should check out [old letters from this series on my website](http://www.craftbyzen.com/letters/season-three/). 

This week, I'm presenting a conversation I had with Raina Evans.  -->

After speaking with Julie, I asked for someone diverse. I recognize I cannot get varied perspectives if I only speak with White America. Enter Raina Eans. She's worn many hats. Her latest description is as the owner of Ready to Rent, a program for residential renters. Raina trains the instructors of this program. After speaking to Raina, I only found a glimpse of how rich her life really is.


## Enter Raina Evans

Raina and Julie's ex-husband used to work for a youth organization in the mid to late 90s. Her daughter and Julie's oldest son used to play together and were the same age. That's how she is connected to Julie.

On the day I spoke to Raina, her daughter and grand kid were just finished having lunch at Black Bear Cafe. And Raina was radiant. This woman is full of energy, excited to talk about what she does, what she's accomplished. It really showed in our conversation as she mentioned her brunch. I knew this was going to be an interesting conversation.

## Ready to Rent

In the early 2000's, Raina was on the Portland housing board commission. The organization ran a training program for first time renters. Dubbed "Ready to Rent". In 2006, the board wanted someone to run this program. They asked around, but couldn't find someone with the right skill set. They kepy getting candidates with social work backgrounds, rather than management and marketing backgrounds. 

The board asked Raina three times before she relented. Raina just got married a few months prior and lost her position on the board. The new marriage came with their own children. At the third time, Raina thought this might be a calling.

Raina gave the board one year to try it out. And then it turned to giving it a second year. By the third year, Raina stayed at this position. But the board came back and told Raina they would be cutting the program.

The board chair asked Raina if she might want to run "Ready to Rent" as a private entity. You see, Ready to Rent's curriculum is one of a kind. There isn't one quite like this. Raina, with the support of the chair, spun this out on her own. To her surprise, the program grew. A lot. Raina took this operation across the US and Canada. She trains instructors to be certified in the program.

By 2010, Raina took the IP from the commission. She's been working at this for a decade and still going strong.

### Memorable Moments

I asked Raina what were some memorable moments she's had training adults. She gave me two stories.

One the big Island of Hawaii, she trained the mayor of Hawaii county. On the first day of training, Raina teaches a class on how adults learn. After this first day, Raina starts teaching the curriculum.

The mayor spoke with Raina after the class was over and said, "Now I get it. We've been communicating wrong this whole time. We've been communication with our people and with clients the wrong way. You taught us how adult learners learn."

The course changed the policy on communicating with each other. An eye opening experience for her.

In another memorable moment, Raina came out to teach in Sacramento, CA. During the first week, she taught city and county workers. The second week, she taught a consortium of agencies. Today, about 100 trainers in Sacramento delivers this curriculum.

The woman who asked Raina to come and teach in Sacramento moved over to another county. She asked Raina to teach people in the county over as well. All in all, Ready to Rent continues to grow through word of mouth. As Raina puts it, "the program markets itself."

### Class Evaluations

Once you are a licensed instructor with Ready to Rent, one requirement in teaching the course is the students fill out class evaluations. Those evaluations are sent back to Raina. This helps Raina gauge how the students and teachers are doing. One of the questions on this evaluation asks the students how prepared they are in renting. "Can they get housing?". The students always respond with students saying they are ready.

The program is taught in prisons. One inmate wrote that he no longer has to lie on housing apps.

80% of evaluations show they would recommend the course to a friend. Raina often sees the same feedback. "Everyone needs to take this course".

The evaluations ask how the instructors are doing. This in turn tells Raina how she's doing as a trainer. I was curious about this because I've written about feedback extensively. This is another use case.

### Marketing

As mentioned on the survey, former students bring "Ready to Rent" up at church, AA meetings, at work. All over.

Raina's niece and boyfriend had a baby shower. The family's mother came out from the other side of Mt. Hood. Essentially the boonies. They may be the only African American family in their town.

The mom was talking about how they send clients to Ready to Rent. She asked Raina if she heard of it, and Raina revealed she's behind it. "You are 'Ready to Rent'?" Raina proves word of mouth is one of the best techniques in marketing. Also, Raina's right. The curriculum is so good, it does market itself.

## Conclusion

I've only scratched the surface behind Raina. In the late 80's. Raina had a talk show on local broadcast called "Let's Talk with Raina". Raina was talking about inclusion and diversity. I have a huge interest on teaching diversity to youth and Raina and I could talk for hours about this. In the introduction, I alluded to diversity as one of the selling points I wanted for my next conversation. Raina is African American, but I don't want to lead with that. I didn't want our inherent biases to cloud her merits and experience. I'll defend taking this approach because anyone can have such rich experiences as Raina has.

Finished having lunch at Black Bear Diner

July training days - online training

Julie - ex-husband (Jonathan) - worked at the same youth organization in the mid to late 90s. Friends through work.

Their eldest son is the same age as Raina's daughter

Raina left that organization, worked at a couple different organization until she worked on the board of the Portland Housing Center. The organization helps home owners. 

She started managing education classes to help rental housing. Organization wanted Raina to fill the role. Less candidates with social services, more to program management and training.

Portland Housing Center - ready to rent, the board really liked it. They asked Raina three times before she agreed to lead the class. She gave it a year, which turned to 3 years. At the end fo the 3rd year, the board decided to stop the program. PHC's director told Raina she should run it on her own. This was around the time she just got married.

In 2006, blended family. Took cirriculum to teach other teachers. Cirriculum took two years for the staff and writers to put together.

Licensed the cirriculum to other organizations. 

2007 - possession of cirriculum of "Ready to Rent"
2010 - gave copyright to Raina's org

## Takeaway message

You never know what you're calling is. You should be open to everything.


## Notes

grandma breakfast -> grandson + daughter = loving them

Black bear cafe, western us, all over California

be anywhere to work <- that's how Raina operates

Training online
Take your work anywhere

How she met Julie

Her ex-husband and Raina worked for same youth organization years ago, back in the mid to late 90's

Oldest son + her daughter same age - played a lot together

Confusing to Raina -> training -> what she does

Julie's husband Johnathan left the organization. Jumped around other organizations. Eventually worked on the board of the Portland housing center. Homeowners

They had an education class called "Ready to Rent"

Barriers to get into rental housing. 
Moved -> head of this class.

They tried to find a replacement but kep getting social services, not someone with a program management / education training background.
No: Social Services
Yes: program management / education training background

Eliminating position for Raina at the board
board asked Raina to head "Ready to Rent"

First time: said no
Second time: said no
Third time: said yes

With some conditions
- evaluate and run for one year and see where they are

Ran it for three years
  Rental education no more, board sought to eliminate the program and Raina's position
  But one of the executive board members asked her to run it as an independent entity

Explore with Raina (2006), she was recently married in november 2005 with a blended family

No startup funds, no budget

Cirriculum is one of a kind. 2 years to write and put it together
For 3 years, licensed it to other organizations. Calling for it, put it on the shelf

Since 2007 - 2010, Ready to rent on license
After 2010, has CC and ownership to Raina

Spends less time marketing
Spends more time on training staff and licensing -> instructor certification

On-site training all around the US and Canada: CT, RI, HI, Canada, CA, NC

Lifework:
  background in communication, PR, marketing

Education:
  wheelhouse = non-traditional educators - how to teach. She loves it!

1,000s of people across US/ Canada

Road path -> middle school, high school, steward of doing this

elementary to college = teaching is a huge difference

90s / early 00s = middle schoolers
  - can morph, has some skill

HS - think they know everything. Have to get "adult" with them

Adults don't like diversity training

MS / HS much easier to understand diversity training (in WA)

Genre of teaching to different groups in high school

### Memorable Moments

training group in big island, HI
Talking about teaching

First day of training is spent on teaching. Later the students get it.

Adult learning principles

Director of city and county of HI after first days said "Now I get it. We've been doing it the wrong way"
  about communicating to each other

"We've been communicating with our people, with clients, the wrong way. You taught us what adult learners needs. How they learn."

Reconfigure how to communicate. Now put the right communication piece"

Memorable training

Sacramento, CA 2015

County in SAC, 2 weeks

Week 1: 30 city + county of sacramento employees
Week 2: 30-32 consortium of agencies

Both groups want training

~100 trainers in SAC delivering this cirriculum

Woman moved the county over and referred a new group of agencies to train! (word of mouth)
She also was the one to open it up to the consortium and wanted it in SAC

She led the call for training

CA has tons of trainees

People who take class

3 ppl as renters were taught homeowning, now are instructors

Class evaluations (feedback)
- never seen negative evaluations
- students get it

Prisoners taught this -> evaluation

Con you get housing now?
Response: No longer have to lie on housing applications

Feedback & evaluations - original cirriculum

through responses, see changes in behavior, and measures effectiveness

As part of teaching the cirriculum, evaluations are sent back to Ready to Rent
(1) how students are doing
(2) how instructors are doing

80% of evals - Would you recommend to friend. Answer: "Everyone needs to take this class"

Outreach - word of moutj
email - staffers (5 ppl)
last 3 months - call from agencies where it was mentioned in meetings
e.g. AA, Dept of behavioral health

Heard from meeting (mentions)
publicity, client needs for housing

Neice + BF: had 1 year old baby. At the baby shower, their mom from mt. hood (Madras OR) heard about the program ready to rent. Told Raina, you're behind it?!

She may be the only African American family in the area. Maybe works in corrections.

We send them to classes (her clients)

How do we connect with people?

Takeaway: you never know what your calling is. Leave yourself open to everything

Next participant: 2 ppl in mind
