## Introduction

Welcome to the Jear Bear Letter's penultimate letter of the series "Seven Degrees of Strangers". If you've just started reading this series, I interview a stranger one degree of separation at a time. And you should check out [old letters from this series on my website](http://www.craftbyzen.com/letters/season-three/). 

This week, I'm presenting a conversation I had with Raina Evans. 

## Enter Raina Evans

<!-- These are notes -->

Finished having lunch at Black Bear Diner

July training days - online training

Julie - ex-husbnad (Jonathan) - worked aat the same youth organization in the mid to late 90s. Friends through work.

Their eldest son is the same age as Raina's daughter

Raina left that organization, worked at a couple different organization until she worked on the board of the Portland Housing Center. The organization helps home owners. 

She started managing education classes to help rental housing. Organizaion wanted Raina to fill the role. Less candidates with social services, more to program management and training.

Portland Housing Center - ready to rent, the board really liked it. They asked Raina three times before she agreed to lead the class. She gave it a year, which turned to 3 years. At the end fo the 3rd year, the board decided to stop the program. PHC's director told Raina she should run it on her own. This was around the time she just got married.

In 2006, blended family. Took cirriculum to teach other teachers. Cirriculum took two years for the staff and writers to put together.

Licensed the cirriculum to other organizations. 

2007 - possession of cirriculum of "Ready to Rent"
2010 - gave copyright to Raina's org

## Takeaway message

You never know what you're calling is. You should be open to everything.


## Notes

grandma breakfast -> grandson + daughter = loving them

Black bear cafe, western us, all over California

be anywhere to work <- that's how Raina operates

Training online
Take your work anywhere

How she met Julie

Her ex-husband and Raina worked for same youth organization years ago, back in the mid to late 90's

Oldest son + her daughter same age - played a lot together

Confusing to Raina -> training -> what she does

Julie's husband Johnathan left the organization. Jumped around other organizations. Eventually worked on the board of the Portland housing center. Homeowners

They had an education class called "Ready to Rent"

Barriers to get into rental housing. 
Moved -> head of this class.

They tried to find a replacement but kep getting social services, not someone with a program management / education training background.
No: Social Services
Yes: program management / education training background

Eliminating position for Raina at the board
board asked Raina to head "Ready to Rent"

First time: said no
Second time: said no
Third time: said yes

With some conditions
- evaluate and run for one year and see where they are

Ran it for three years
  Rental education no more, board sought to eliminate the program and Raina's position
  But one of the executive board members asked her to run it as an independent entity

Explore with Raina (2006), she was recently married in november 2005 with a blended family

No startup funds, no budget

Cirriculum is one of a kind. 2 years to write and put it together
For 3 years, licensed it to other organizations. Calling for it, put it on the shelf

Since 2007 - 2010, Ready to rent on license
After 2010, has CC and ownership to Raina

Spends less time marketing
Spends more time on training staff and licensing -> instructor certification

On-site training all around the US and Canada: CT, RI, HI, Canada, CA, NC

Lifework:
  background in communication, PR, marketing

Education:
  wheelhouse = non-traditional educators - how to teach. She loves it!

1,000s of people across US/ Canada

Road path -> middle school, high school, steward of doing this

elementary to college = teaching is a huge difference

90s / early 00s = middle schoolers
  - can morph, has some skill

HS - think they know everything. Have to get "adult" with them

Adults don't like diversity training

MS / HS much easier to understand diversity training (in WA)

Genre of teaching to different groups in high school

### Memorable Moments

training group in big island, HI
Talking about teaching

First day of training is spent on teaching. Later the students get it.

Adult learning principles

Director of city and county of HI after first days said "Now I get it. We've been doing it the wrong way"
  about communicating to each other

"We've been communicating with our people, with clients, the wrong way. You taught us what adult learners needs. How they learn."

Reconfigure how to communicate. Now put the right communication piece"

Memorable training

Sacramento, CA 2015

County in SAC, 2 weeks

Week 1: 30 city + county of sacramento employees
Week 2: 30-32 consortium of agencies

Both groups want training

~100 trainers in SAC delivering this cirriculum

Woman moved the county over and referred a new group of agencies to train! (word of mouth)
She also was the one to open it up to the consortium and wanted it in SAC

She led the call for training

CA has tons of trainees

People who take class

3 ppl as renters were taught homeowning, now are instructors

Class evaluations (feedback)
- never seen negative evaluations
- students get it

Prisoners taught this -> evaluation

Con you get housing now?
Response: No longer have to lie on housing applications

Feedback & evaluations - original cirriculum

through responses, see changes in behavior, and measures effectiveness

As part of teaching the cirriculum, evaluations are sent back to Ready to Rent
(1) how students are doing
(2) how instructors are doing

80% of evals - Would you recommend to friend. Answer: "Everyone needs to take this class"

Outreach - word of moutj
email - staffers (5 ppl)
last 3 months - call from agencies where it was mentioned in meetings
e.g. AA, Dept of behavioral health

Heard from meeting (mentions)
publicity, client needs for housing

Neice + BF: had 1 year old baby. At the baby shower, their mom from mt. hood (Madras OR) heard about the program ready to rent. Told Raina, you're behind it?!

She may be the only African American family in the area. Maybe works in corrections.

We send them to classes (her clients)

How do we connect with people?

Takeaway: you never know what your calling is. Leave yourself open to everything

Next participant: 2 ppl in mind

Diversity Cirriculum - late 80s

hosted local tv talk show - interview people - talk show formal

"Let's talk with Raina"

Degrees of diversity
