## Introduction

Last week, I wrote about my interview with Joe Lazzara, owner of Joe's Butcher and Fish Market. This week, we're reviewing the core of the series. If you haven't followed along with this newsletter series, I'm interviewing strangers one degree of separation at a time to chronicle connections. And there's no one better to talk about connection none other than Mary Aipoalani.

## Enter Mary Aipoalani

I had absolutely no background on Mary when I asked her to be my next interviewee. I called her a few days before our interview to schedule the meeting, and immediately, I knew I was going to enjoy our conversation. She had an energy in her voice like she's ready for anything that came her way.

Mary came from humble beginings in Indiana. She grew up on a farm and her food was her family’s language. She and her husband travel around all over the US, selling and managing food products. From what I can access, Mary is a busy person yet knows how to find time for people. Case in point, during our conversation, she was driving her daughter to an appointment.

If you’ve read Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Mary’s a prime example of a super-connector.

## My Notes 

<!-- Do not use these -->

Connection to Joe

Facilities -> VP of Business Development at Renaissance Food Groups
Retail floors

Venture in town (Carmel) -> lots of money downtown

Talked about 2 hours with Joe. Mary has an eye for the next big innovation. Sell in the marketplace. Beautiful, unique.

Williams & Sonoma + other business connections
familiy owned

Tells Joe about Competition they sell to near his business

Mary travels a lot and is very well connected.
She keeps notes (and maybe tabs) on people. She stores them on her phone -> Big and descriptive.

Includes details of Where she met them, what they do
- Maybe be part of something else
- If I had to contact someone, I could reach out to them

For example, with Joe, she could ask him about food and wine pairings, spices and seasoning blends

Business card, emails, when talking, think of descriptive things to write about them

Renaissance Food Group in Sacramento, Rancho Cordove, CA

Grew up in midwest??

PDX -> Bay Area -> Sacramento

Product launch at Target

She has 2 chilren - 2 girls

You never know who these people you jot down could be useful in which role:
- Advisory board candidates
- Head hunters
-Recommendations to make something else -> Innovation

Mary's theory: "When the student is ready, they have to find the right teacher"

Mary is always growing, developing, and bringing people together

The heart of networking is to bring people together. "I was born to network"

When Mary has information, she sees if she can apply it for someone

Cellphone - keep keywords

E.g. Wharton School, Investor, needs seed money

Snap photo of notes or record audio or type it up

Notes for helping research + phone call to see next steps / funding

Plane - Meeting, business cards, phone #, LinkedIn

1. Enjoy people
2. Ellen Degeneras - be interested in people
- Resources
- What they are good at

Categorization: buckets and fields

E.g. one bucket for food, another for Cars.

Out in the country

The buckets are code-specific keywords. Must be purposeful + mindful

Mary can search through these buckets - LinkedIn, Uber. See what their interests lie. CFO, Reference

COO in Tampa, FL (Target)

Keep up with Who is who / trends (in food industry)
- Reading + screenshots

Notes in phone are a huge help
+ Face recognition - Search meat buyer -> Maybe not the person, but find the right person (journey)

Mary has a couple companies on the side

I could go to the White House: "I'm pretty sure I could go to the White House with little to no credentials". Because I think that in my mind.

2 months to get to know someone
2 years to get them to like you

Traveling is a great way to make connections. Listen better, fewer distractions

Dress appropriately
- No sweatpants
- Dress up. Why? People judge you by your appearance
	- Business attire attract business people

1,000s of examples: TV show, side companies

Detailed information - write those down after meeting them

Don't want to connect? yes. Must be at the right space, right time
"No coincidences" - I have nothing but coincidences, and that's led to success

Genuinely interested in learning and growing -> When I was younger...
-> Looking to connect -> real entrepreneur thing

More entrepreneurs work on connecting. They are resourceful and utilize people

They must learn givers and takers. Entrepreneurs are givers.

No connection, not going to happen

Connection as a craft - born with it - younger = allowed to
Some not - not raised in that aggregate

Mary has a 10 year old and a 12 year old. They are great connectors. They remember first and last name basis.

Children should be raised in an environment where connecting is important. With her children, they are taught to look people in the eye, talk like an adult

They need to learn the secret formula - exposure to connecting, which in turn grows confidence.
But many of us have a fear of being rejected and judged.

Friends, other people, no negative experiences.

Open and attracted to mary because mary smiles and looks people in the eye.

Mary has an idea for a show and may have some producers on board. 

Mary sits at the bar. Profiles it to see if someone is wrapping up with their meal. She will intentionally sit close to them. When the bartender asks her what she'd like to eat, she turn to this person and ask what are they having. Here's the pitch. She asks this person if she can try some of their food. 

"I was thinking of ordering that"

It's such a joke - "You inspire me" says her Jewish Uber driver

Why? I want to have a connection, conversation. Then they end up conversing, buy each other drinks, maybe dessert. 

She's done this in front of friends. When she's successful, she gives her friends a wink and a thumb's up. "That's how you do it"

We all have a good story to tell. I'm like a walking Yelp and can talk about any restaurant in the US. 

And Mary isn't picking anyone up. She talks about her husband and the stranger may talk about their life.

Bring it back to food - instead of being alone by herself.

Lessons to be learned. Her father was like that. He could go up to anyone and talk to them.

When he died, the guneral was packed. People heard from the paper. It was inspiring because he made such an impact to people. He reached out and helped. He reached out to the poor and reached out to everyone. 

Her daughter, Ava, has straight A's.

It's a balance and karma that keeps us going.

Major connections? Reach out to her brother, Ed Dominion. Maiden name Dominion. He's D6, being 6th in the family. Mary's D3. Connect for IoT jobs / connection?

Big family of 7

Family of entrepreneurs

Side companies in cameras, animal bacon, seed $$

Names, names, names

Fred Madero -> Seminar -> Helped orient him at t table

Black Rock -> Justice Alieto

## The Game

With all of this traveling Mary does, she spends a lot of time eating on her own. She doesn't eat alone though. She told me about this game she plays when she's at a restaurant with a bar. She scouts the bar area to see if there are any patrons eating alone. If there is, she'll sit near them. Once the waiter has given he a menu, she looks over to her neighbor's plate and ask him or her, "Oh, that looks good. What are you eating?". Mary's never had a time where the patron has not answered her.

Now the real game has started. After striking this conversation, Mary's intent is to see if she can get her patron to offer her a sample from their plate. To Mary's recollection, every patron has given her food.

I asked if she got to get her daughter to do that. Her daughter spoke up and said she's done it once.

## Managing Connections

listening

## Takeaway message

Take the opportunity to reach out to people. And Mary has a saying to go along with this. "Stop looking at your glass, get off your ass". Her daughter was listening to the conversation, and told me she couldn't say that last word. 

Mary says in the younger community, boys are always on their glass. Yet, it's important to move your ass, whether it be exercise, smiling and making eye contact with other people, or working on body language. That's how she sees life.

## Author Notes

I lost half of our conversation. Mary was driving through poor cell service areas, so the call dropped a number of times. For the last portion of the interview, I couldn't record it so I transcribed notes. As my luck would have it, my notes were stolen along with my backpack. I've chosen to omit this conversation because my memory is impartial and to be frank, I can't remember what we talked about.
