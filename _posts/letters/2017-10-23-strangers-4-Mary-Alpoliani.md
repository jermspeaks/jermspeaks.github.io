## Introduction

Last week, I wrote about my interview with Joe Lazzara, owner of Joe's Butcher and Fish Market. This week, we're reviewing the core of the series. If you haven't followed along with this newsletter series, I'm interviewing strangers one degree of separation at a time to chronicle connections. And there's no one better to talk about connection none other than Mary Aipoalani.

## Enter Mary Aipoalani

I had absolutely no background on Mary when I asked her to be my next interviewee. I called her a few days before our interview to schedule the meeting, and immediately, I knew I was going to enjoy our conversation. She had an energy in her voice like she's ready for anything that came her way.

Mary came from humble beginings in Indiana. She grew up on a farm and her food was her family’s language. She and her husband travel around all over the US, selling and managing food products. From what I can access, Mary is a busy person yet knows how to find time for people. Case in point, during our conversation, she was driving her daughter to an appointment.

If you’ve read Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Mary’s a prime example of a super-connector.

## The Game

With all of this traveling Mary does, she spends a lot of time eating on her own. She doesn't eat alone though. She told me about this game she plays when she's at a restaurant with a bar. She scouts the bar area to see if there are any patrons eating alone. If there is, she'll sit near them. Once the waiter has given he a menu, she looks over to her neighbor's plate and ask him or her, "Oh, that looks good. What are you eating?". Mary's never had a time where the patron has not answered her.

Now the real game has started. After striking this conversation, Mary's intent is to see if she can get her patron to offer her a sample from their plate. To Mary's recollection, every patron has given her food.

I asked if she got to get her daughter to do that. Her daughter spoke up and said she's done it once.

## Managing Connections

listening

## Takeaway message

"Stop looking at your glass, get off your ass". Her daughter was listening to the conversation, and told me she couldn't say that last word. Which was very cute.

## Author Notes

I lost half of our conversation. Mary was driving through poor cell service areas, so the call dropped a number of times. For the last portion of the interview, I couldn't record it so I transcribed notes. As my luck would have it, my notes were stolen along with my backpack. I've chosen to omit this conversation because my memory is impartial and to be frank, I can't remember what we talked about.
