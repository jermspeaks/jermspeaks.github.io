## Introduction

I get this text from Mary two weeks after our interview that says "you need to connect with her. I just told her about you." There was a VCard attached, but my phone couldn't tell how to parse it. I had to take the raw VCard text, convert it on my computer, then add it to my contacts online.

Unlike all of the strangers before, I can't tell you the connection between Mary and Julie. So who is she?

## Enter Julie Valenti

Julie runs the Wellness center in Portland, Or. When I spoke to her, she had just moved to San Diego, Ca. She spends some time every two weeks up in Portland to help with logistics for the center, then takes clients remotely.

Instead of going over Julie's background, I decided to devote my time with her to talk about empty nest syndrome, learning about her book, and the writing process.

## Childhood PTSD

Julie grew up in Idaho with an alcoholic father and a ?? mother. When she went to college, she studied psychology. 

## Therapy and the 20 Concepts

Some therapies can be prolonged for decades. Patients come back, lie on the couch, and talk out their issues to their therapist. Rinse and repeat for years to decades, and it feel like all the therapist is there for is someone who will listen, for a hefty sum.

But Julie's program is different. She relates all of our mental problems with neuropsychology and hormone imbalances.
