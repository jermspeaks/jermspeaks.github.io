## Introduction

I get this text from Mary two weeks after our interview that says "you need to connect with her. I just told her about you." There was a VCard attached, but my phone couldn't tell how to parse it. I had to take the raw VCard text, convert it on my computer, then add it to my contacts online.

Unlike all of the strangers before, I can't tell you the connection between Mary and Julie. So who is she?

## Enter Julie Valenti

Julie runs the Wellness center in Portland, Or. When I spoke to her, she had just moved to San Diego, Ca. She spends some time every two weeks up in Portland to help with logistics for the center, then takes clients remotely.

Instead of going over Julie's background, I decided to devote my time with her to talk about empty nest syndrome, learning about her book, and the writing process.

## Childhood PTSD

Julie grew up in Idaho with an alcoholic father and a ?? mother. When she went to college, she studied psychology. 

## Therapy and the 20 Concepts

Some therapies can be prolonged for decades. Patients come back, lie on the couch, and talk out their issues to their therapist. Rinse and repeat for years to decades, and it feel like all the therapist is there for is someone who will listen, for a hefty sum.

But Julie's program is different. She relates all of our mental problems with neuropsychology and hormone imbalances.

## Empty Nest Syndrome

Julie's got two children who have moved away. One in LA and another somewhere else. I was very curious how Julie deals with her children moved away. 
And in turn, how do I resolve my mother's requests and demands now the children have left.
As Julie explains it to me, "empty nest syndrome" is a fancy term for grief. Now that the children are gone, the mother grieves, and the grieving process isn't an easy road. 
What can help is to discuss what the role of mother and child are now, and to develop boundaries of where each one lies. The compromise of each party is how we should resolve this mental conflict. 

For Julie, that was to have a conversation with her son in LA about how often they would talk over the phone. It would be how often they would meet up since Julie lives within driving distance to her son. Or it's how much space they needed from each other so Julie wouldn't be suffucating her child. 

And in a way, I wanted to have this conversation with my mother. I asked Julie about this, and by the end of our conversation, I had a task, to reach out to my mother and have this conversation.

## Takeaway message

Julie's takeaway is to understand and resolve your childhood trauma. Resolution may come in the form of rewiring your brain.
