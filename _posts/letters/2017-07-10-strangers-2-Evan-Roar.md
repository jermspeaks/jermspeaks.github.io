## Introduction

Last week, I talked to Simon Gonedeck, a young Web Developer and Entrepreneur. 
This week, I'm talking to Evan Roar, Simon's friend. This is the second 
installment of my series about connectedness. If you missed the newsletter 
last week, I encourage you to read it. However, you do not need to read that 
first to understand this week's newsletter.

## Enter Evan

The first thing I wanted to know about Evan was how did he know Simon? As Evan recalls, he's known Simon and Sevy, Simon's twin brother, for as long as he can remember. Growing up, Evan's and Simon's families were part of the same culinary club. Evan's older brother is roommates with Simon's older brother. When Evan's family moved to North Carolina when Evan was in third grade, the families kept in touch. If Evan's travelling to Minneapolis, which happens once or twice a year, he's staying with Simon.

Evan resides in Raleigh, North Carolina. He works for Design Dimensions, a design firm specializing in exhibit design for museums. He started this job a year ago and has an unconventional story on how he landed the job.

## Landing the Job

Evan was a brand ambassador at NC state for the university's recreation center. Evan would setup tables and handout merchandise. Part of being a brand ambassador was adhering to 13 hours of office hours. But for Evan, he didn't need that much time to finish his work. With all of this free time, he noticed peers making posters in the gym promoting upcoming events. That was his introduction to graphic design in the works.

Evan was studying business marketing, and he happened to stumble into graphic design. With his boss' permission, he helped create some posters. Because Evan wasn't a design student, he would take some of his free time to take courses on Lynda.com to learn the professional software suite. Evan would continue to create posters until he graduated. At that point, he had a nice portfolio.

Come post-graduation, when it was time to find a job, Evan applied to both design studios and businesses seeking his skills in Business Marketing. One of those design firms he submitted his portfolio to was Design Dimensions. 

Evan got an internship with an tech firm and had started working for a week or two before Design Dimensions called him. He thought it would be worth a shot at the interview since his current role may not hire him full-time. And it was very convenient since his internship was five buildings away from the Design Dimensions.

Evan was the only candidate without a design degree. He meshed well with the firm's lead designer, Betsy, his future boss. She liked Evan's portfolio, and his taste in music. And it helped they both went to the same school where Evan's fraternity had close ties to Betsy's sorority. And Betsy likes to blast music in the design studio, and because whoever she had to work with would be in close quarters to her, the candidate had to mesh well with her. And Evan sure did, so he was hired.

*Footnote* There's a similar story I've read in Jessica Hische's book, "In Progress", in which she describes her desk and workspace she shares with. Designers are selective in who they choose to keep.

### What have you learned working there?

The short answer is a lot. One year is a lot to go through many clients. For example, last Monday, Evan could be juggling through 10 clients. His strong point is graphic design.

Museums he works with generally comes up with the content and its the designer's job to make it presentable.

It's Evan's job to take a given space, like venues, museums, and exhibition spaces, and design the entire experience, from the look and feel, to the overall experience. It's a small office and very long standing over the past few decades. The original founder still comes by even though he is in his late seventies.

It's only recently he's been doing more back and forth with the client.
Normally, the client comes with the specs and the designer can work with it.
Occasionally, the client also wants to be the designer and put their two cents into it. It reminds me the first iteration of your work will not be your last.
Rarely is that the case with freelancing either.

## Takeaways

Evan's one thing he wants everyone to takeaway with is...
