            <span>A weekly, longform essay that mainly focuses on lessons I've learned.</span>
            <span>I try to write something I find meaningful, whether it's exposing your ignorance,</span>
            <span>staying true to yourself or being resilient.</span>
            <span>In a world of tweet-sized advice and short comments on a non-sensical Facebook post,</span>
            <span>there's not enough time to process and distill what we're actually thinking.</span>
            <span>These letters are to slow down, lean in and really try to form more coherent thoughts</span>
            <span>than writing that instant gratification post on my choice of social networking site.</span>
