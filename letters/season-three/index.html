              <span>Welcome to the third series of the Jear-Bear letters.</span>
              <span>For the new readers, this is my weekly newsletter.</span>
              <span>I used to write short essays of things that interested me</span>
              <span>with an intention I could read this a year later and remain interested.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>During months of February and March, I will be writing letters on the theme of <strong>"repeated failure"</strong>.</span>
              <span>Expect releases on Monday, unless I get too busy and release a Tuesday letter.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>If you like what you're reading, share this newsletter.</span>
              <span>You could go as far as sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, or going retro, snail mail!</span>
              <span>If you're feeling adventurous, subscribe them by entering their email on</span>
              <span><a href="http://tinyletter.com/jeremywong/">my Tinyletter page.</a></span>

            <h2>Addendum</h2>

            <p>The project is a mix of two projects. The first is Megan Gilbert's blog, "52 
            Cups of Tea". In that blog, she interviews a person a week over tea or coffee 
            in preparation for getting prepared for finding a job in the real world 
            outside of college.</p>

            <p>The second is Kio Stark's newsletter and book talking to strangers. In the 
            series, Kio recounts stories she has with starngers in NYC. She keeps 
            reminding me I want to talk with random people and share worldviews.</p>

            <p>For the old readers, thanks for your patience. I know it's months between the 
            last newsletter, and I'm really happy to share the next few weeks with you. 
            And to the new readers, I hope you'll love what you're about to read.</p>
