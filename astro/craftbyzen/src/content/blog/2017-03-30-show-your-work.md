# Show Your Work

### Show your work
If it's meaningful to you, share it with the world.
If it means something to someone else, your work has legacy.

### Live your work
Your work has meaning when you have breathed life in it.
Like a blacksmith beating a piece of metal, you too beat your life into your work.

### Give your work away
If your work has copies, give those copies away.
If the original is worth something to you, giving your work away gives that someone a piece of yourself.
Memory may fade, but if your work is a legacy, it can stand the test of time.

### Destroy your work
Every life and creation can be destroyed. Your work is no different.
If you set your work free, your work can be crushed.
This is not a bad thing. Nature is agnostic to the forces of good and evil.

## Notes

The piece of prose is inspired by the book, "[Show Your Work](http://showyourwork.com)" by Austin Kleon.
