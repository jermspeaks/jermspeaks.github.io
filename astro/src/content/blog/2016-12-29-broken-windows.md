# Software Entropy Revisited

In one chapter from [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/software-entropy), they have a chapter dedicated to Software Entropy.
In it, the author explains...

> In inner cities, some buildings are beautiful and clean, while others are rotting hulks.
> Why? Researchers in the field of crime and urban decay discovered a fascinating trigger mechanism,
> one that very quickly turns a clean, intact, inhabited building into a smashed and abandoned derelict.

> A broken window.

> One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time,
> instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment -— a sense that the powers that be don’t care about the building.
> So another window gets broken.
> People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural damage begins.
> In a relatively short space of time, the building becomes damaged beyond the owner’s desire to fix it,
> and the sense of abandonment becomes reality.

> The “Broken Window Theory” has inspired police departments in New York
> and other major cities to crack down on the small stuff in order to keep out the big stuff.
> It works: keeping on top of broken windows, graffiti, and other small infractions has reduced the serious crime level.
